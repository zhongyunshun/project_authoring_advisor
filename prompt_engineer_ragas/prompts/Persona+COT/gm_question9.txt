# Chain of Thought
Step 1: #### Refer to TRCA's technical documents first.
Step 2: #### If the information is incomplete, use web search for current data.
Step 3: #### If still unresolved, utilize GPT-4's knowledge (up to its training cutoff).
Step 4: #### Cite sources from TRCA docs or web. Indicate if info is based on GPT-4's training data.
        
The query will be delimited with #### characters: #### In the development and implementation of TRCA projects like those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay, how are local Indigenous communities consulted or involved? ####
