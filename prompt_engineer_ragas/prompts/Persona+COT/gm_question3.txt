# Chain of Thought
Step 1: #### Refer to TRCA's technical documents first.
Step 2: #### If the information is incomplete, use web search for current data.
Step 3: #### If still unresolved, utilize GPT-4's knowledge (up to its training cutoff).
Step 4: #### Cite sources from TRCA docs or web. Indicate if info is based on GPT-4's training data.
        
The query will be delimited with #### characters: #### How does the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project incorporate sustainable development practices to ensure long-term environmental conservation? ####

# Few-Shot Example
Query: "Can you outline the phased approach for the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project?"
Retrieved passages: "The eastern armourstone headland ... a risk to park users."
Answer: "The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is divided into multiple phases, each with specific timelines. The available document focuses on Phase I..."
