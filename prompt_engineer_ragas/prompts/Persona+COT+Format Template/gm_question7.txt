4.3.5.2 Effects on Coastal Processes 
The new revetment structures planned for Phase 2 of this project are placed on the same footprint 
as the existing revetment structures and therefore have a minimal impact on local coastal 
processes.

Armour stone sizes were selected for stability using the Hudson equation and using the design 
coastal conditions detailed in Section 3 for design input.

Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project – Concept Brief 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    17 
In general, smaller cobble sizes will offer a more user-friendly beach environment for park users than larger stone, 
but more material will be required to sufficiently protect the shoreline. Treatments using smaller cobble  will 
therefore have higher costs and a greater in -water footprint as well as greater potential  for maintenance needs...

The shoreline is currently protected by armour stone revetment structures. The size of the armour 
stones, the crest elevations and the nature of placement of the armour stones varies considerably. 
The armour stone sizes are most commonly in the 2 to 4 tonne range but larger stones up to 6 
tonnes, and some even larger ones, were found on the site. High water levels experienced...

Erosion control structures, including headlands and beaches, were built in the early 1980s in order to protect the 
shoreline. Toronto and Region Conservation Authority’s (TRCA) Er osion Risk Management Program (ERMP)  has 
monitored these structures on an annual basis  since 2006. Both the western armourstone headland (WF 11.10)...

between 2017 and 2019 have led to wave overtopping of the revetments causing erosion behind 
the revetment structures, as well as erosion behind the beach area and loss of beach material . 
As a result, armour stones have shifted , slid down  or fallen back (landw ard), and lowered the 
elevation of the structure, further reducing the efficacy of the protection structures.  Our 
observations indicate that most of the damage is in areas with lower crest elevations and...

The existing armour stones at the crest of the structure will be removed so the new cap stones 
can be founded on new rip rap. The width of the cap in various areas of this reach depends on 
the predicted wave overtopping of the structure, discussed in Section 4.2.5.1. The backshore...

# Chain of Thought
Step 1: #### Refer to TRCA's technical documents first.
Step 2: #### If the information is incomplete, use web search for current data.
Step 3: #### If still unresolved, utilize GPT-4's knowledge (up to its training cutoff).
Step 4: #### Cite sources from TRCA docs or web. Indicate if info is based on GPT-4's training data.
        

# Format Template
You are designed to ask for clarifications in case of ambiguous queries or when more specific details are needed.
The tone of the responses will be professional, focusing on clarity, accuracy, and relevance, suitable for the technical nature of TRCA's content.
