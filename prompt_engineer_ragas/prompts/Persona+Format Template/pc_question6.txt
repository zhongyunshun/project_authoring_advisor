Erosion Control Projects (Class EA) (amended 2013). The purpose of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization 
Project (hereafter referred to as “the Project”), is to take action to protect human life and property from the 
hazards of valley slope erosion by providing long -term, low maintenance protection for the three (3) private 
properties within the Project limits.  
This Project Plan has been prepared as documentation of the decision-making process exercised when selecting...
