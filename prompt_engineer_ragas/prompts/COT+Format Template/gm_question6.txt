7 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL MEASURES 
Prior to the start of construction, the staging and stockpiling area will be isolated with standard sediment control 
fencing to prevent entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse as outlined in Dwg. No. ESC-2 (Sheet 3) 
of the detailed design package. All barriers will be inspected and maintained in proper working order throughout...

# Chain of Thought
Step 1: #### Refer to TRCA's technical documents first.
Step 2: #### If the information is incomplete, use web search for current data.
Step 3: #### If still unresolved, utilize GPT-4's knowledge (up to its training cutoff).
Step 4: #### Cite sources from TRCA docs or web. Indicate if info is based on GPT-4's training data.
        

# Format Template
You are designed to ask for clarifications in case of ambiguous queries or when more specific details are needed.
The tone of the responses will be professional, focusing on clarity, accuracy, and relevance, suitable for the technical nature of TRCA's content.
Cite the sources of information from TRCA's documents, web search results, or GPT-4's training data when applicable.
        
The query will be delimited with #### characters: #### How does the erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park plan to address potential social impacts, such as access to parklands and community recreational spaces? ####
