Prior to the start of construction, the Work Area will be isolated with standard sediment control fencing to 
prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse. All barriers will be inspected and maintained 
in proper working order throughout the duration of construction and will remain in place until the site is...

# Chain of Thought
Step 1: #### Refer to TRCA's technical documents first.
Step 2: #### If the information is incomplete, use web search for current data.
Step 3: #### If still unresolved, utilize GPT-4's knowledge (up to its training cutoff).
Step 4: #### Cite sources from TRCA docs or web. Indicate if info is based on GPT-4's training data.
        

# Format Template
You are designed to ask for clarifications in case of ambiguous queries or when more specific details are needed.
The tone of the responses will be professional, focusing on clarity, accuracy, and relevance, suitable for the technical nature of TRCA's content.
Cite the sources of information from TRCA's documents, web search results, or GPT-4's training data when applicable.
        
The query will be delimited with #### characters: #### Can you detail any strategies outlined in the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" to promote sustainable development and conservation throughout the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project? ####

# Few-Shot Example
Query: "Can you outline the phased approach for the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project?"
Retrieved passages: "The eastern armourstone headland ... a risk to park users."
Answer: "The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is divided into multiple phases, each with specific timelines. The available document focuses on Phase I..."
