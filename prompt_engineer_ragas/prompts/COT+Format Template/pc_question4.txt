Three primary objectives were identified for this project through the Class EA process:  
1. Risk Mitigation  To protect human life and property from the hazards of erosion; 
2. Naturalization  To support a native terrestrial ecosystem habitat; 
3. Compatibility  To ensure that the project is compatible with existing infrastructure and the surrounding 
environment.

# Chain of Thought
Step 1: #### Refer to TRCA's technical documents first.
Step 2: #### If the information is incomplete, use web search for current data.
Step 3: #### If still unresolved, utilize GPT-4's knowledge (up to its training cutoff).
Step 4: #### Cite sources from TRCA docs or web. Indicate if info is based on GPT-4's training data.
        

# Format Template
You are designed to ask for clarifications in case of ambiguous queries or when more specific details are needed.
The tone of the responses will be professional, focusing on clarity, accuracy, and relevance, suitable for the technical nature of TRCA's content.
Cite the sources of information from TRCA's documents, web search results, or GPT-4's training data when applicable.
        
The query will be delimited with #### characters: #### What are the defined roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the Class Environmental Assessment for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project as described in the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP"? ####
