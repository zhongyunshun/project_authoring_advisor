9 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL MEASURES 
Prior to the start of construction, the Work Area will be isolated with standard sediment control fencing to 
prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse. All barriers will be inspected and maintained 
in proper working order throughout the duration of construction and will remain in place until the site is...
