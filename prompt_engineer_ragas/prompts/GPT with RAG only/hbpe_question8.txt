If the prescribed measures on the plans are not effective in preventing the release of deleterious substance, including sediment, then alternative measures must be implemented immediately to minimize potential ecological impacts.

4.0 Monitoring 
PreͲconstruction  and  postͲconstruction  erosion  monitoring  of  the  proposed  works  should  be 
implemented including a record of photographs.  Monitoring of proposed vegetation should also be 
conducted for two (2) years after planting to ensure survivability.  The monitoring activities should 
include (but not limited to): ...

Detailed Scope of Work 
The overall approach to the designs was to prioritize long-term resiliency while reducing the need for excavation 
and off -site disposal to limit disturbance and impacts of the construction activities  as well as addressing the 
leading erosion conc erns of the park, including low crest elevation and wave overtopping. The desig ns address 
these concerns by placing new material over the existing structures where toe and slope stability permits thereby...

The scope of work for Phase II will include the items listed below and will be completed in the following general 
sequence: 
1. Site setup including establishment of staging/stockpiling areas at the western headland, removal of 
required trees, and installation of ESC measures, tree protection, and site perimeter control.  
2. Limited regrading of native fill material to accommodate repair works and establishment of...
