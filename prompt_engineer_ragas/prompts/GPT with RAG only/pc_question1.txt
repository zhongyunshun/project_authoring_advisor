• The location of the projected long-term stable slope crest (LTSSC) in relation to permanent and essential 
structures at the top of slope; 
• The presence of a public footpath at the base of slope; and 
• The presence of potentially impacted infrastructure located within the tributary and surrounding area...

The LTS SC models the natural regression of a slope crest resulting from erosion forces and is based on the 
composition and conditions  of substrate materials. As part of the 2015 SS&ERA, Cole Engineering Group Ltd.  
conducted a subsurface investigation to delineate the LTSSC behind Peacham Crescent using a factor of safety 
(FoS) of 1.5. As can be seen in Figure 7, the positioning of th is LTSSC intersects the corner of the residential...
