proposed concepts have been designed to  address these concerns by plac ing new material over the existing 
structures where toe and slope stability permits, thereby minimizing excavation requirements. Two sections have...

levels. Additional stone has been placed in many of the scours to temporarily improve shoreline protection (Figure 
5 and Figure 6), however, these are interim measures only. The western limit of the structure near the transition...

At its eastern limit, the headland  transitions into beach  WF11.11. At this transition point, the concept design 
includes the creation of a berm, consisting of 2-3 tonne armourstone, to create a formal outlet area for the ponds 
(Figure 16 and Figure 17). The elevation of the treatment will be 78.5 m.a.s.l. (Figure 17). The pond will drain into...

In general, smaller cobble sizes will offer a more user-friendly beach environment for park users than larger stone, 
but more material will be required to sufficiently protect the shoreline. Treatments using smaller cobble  will 
therefore have higher costs and a greater in -water footprint as well as greater potential  for maintenance needs...

5. Repair of the pond outlet area by creating an armourstone berm that allows for drainage of the 
ponds. This will include: 
a. Excavation of the existing bed to prepare for installation of the armourstone. 
b. Placement of the geotextile base and 300-600 mm as core stone as well as 3-5 tonne 
armourstones to act as toe stones....

The concept designs for the beach call for placement of fill over the existing profile of the beach (Figure 19). Four 
alternative options were proposed  for the beach treatment which  vary based on the cobble size and required 
quantity, ranging from 10 to 100 mm diameter stone (Figure 20). Profile details of the four options are summarized...
