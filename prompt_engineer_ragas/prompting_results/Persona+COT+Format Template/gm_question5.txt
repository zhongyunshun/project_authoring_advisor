The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is structured into three distinct phases for design and implementation. This multi-year project aims to address significant erosion concerns, particularly following high lake level events and severe weather conditions that have affected the shoreline.

Additionally, the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project has its own set of objectives and planned phases. While the specific documents retrieved do not explicitly mention future phases beyond those currently outlined, the nature of these projects typically involves ongoing assessment and potential future expansions as conditions evolve or further needs are identified.

For detailed information on the current phases and any potential future plans, it would be advisable to refer to the most recent updates or reports released by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA).
