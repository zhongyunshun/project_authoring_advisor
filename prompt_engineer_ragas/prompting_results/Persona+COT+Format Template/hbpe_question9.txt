The planning and implementation phases of TRCA projects involve detailed engagement and consultation with local Indigenous communities. Here are some key points regarding this process:

1. **Indigenous Community Consultation**: Prior to delivering any notifications, TRCA contacts the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) for guidance on which Indigenous communities should be consulted. The engagement process varies depending on the project scope and the specific interests of the communities involved (Document 2).

2. **Consultation Records**: TRCA maintains a record of consultations with Indigenous communities, which includes all correspondence and outlines the monitoring programs that will commence upon project completion (Document 7).

3. **Community Engagement Practices**: The engagement process respects the cultures and practices of the Indigenous communities involved. Open dialogue and opportunities for feedback are integral to ensure meaningful engagement (Document 4).

4. **Specific Indigenous Communities Engaged**: For example, during the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, TRCA engaged with various Indigenous groups, including the Credit First Nation and the Williams Treaties First Nations. No adverse effects on traditional land uses were identified during these engagements (Document 3).

5. **Ongoing Communication**: TRCA ensures that Indigenous groups are kept informed about archaeological assessments and environmental studies, and they are invited to participate actively in these processes (Document 15).

In summary, TRCA's approach to Indigenous engagement is designed to be inclusive and respectful, ensuring that the voices of local Indigenous communities are heard throughout the planning and implementation phases of their projects.
