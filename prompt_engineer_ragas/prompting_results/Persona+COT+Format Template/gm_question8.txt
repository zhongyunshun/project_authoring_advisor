The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects like the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project involve regular inspections and assessments. According to the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) documents, the site will undergo inspections during the first year after major storm events and will be monitored annually thereafter. This routine inspection aims to ensure that the implemented erosion control works remain stable and perform as designed. Any maintenance required will be addressed as needed to uphold the integrity of the structures and the surrounding environment (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I, Page 36; HBPE Project Brief - Phase II, Page 37).
