The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity through careful planning and mitigation strategies, particularly concerning bat species and butternut trees identified in the project area.

1. **Bat Species**: The project recognizes the presence of bat habitat within the project limits. To mitigate impacts on these species, the TRCA's Environmental Resource Management (ERM) Project staff will coordinate appropriate compensation measures in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol. This ensures that the project aligns with conservation efforts for species at risk, particularly those in treed habitats (Document 8).

2. **Butternut Trees**: A Category 2 butternut tree has been identified along the proposed access route for the project. This tree is classified as endangered under Ontarioâ€™s Endangered Species Act and is susceptible to butternut canker. Genetic testing confirmed that the butternut within the construction access route is genetically pure, indicating a high risk of impact due to the disease (Document 2). The project plans to implement tree removals and other construction activities selectively to minimize effects on this tree and its surrounding habitat (Document 21).

3. **Biodiversity Mitigation Measures**: The project aims to minimize overall impacts by planning tree removals selectively and timing construction activities outside critical periods, such as the bird breeding window (Document 20). Additionally, post-construction restoration efforts will focus on replanting native species to enhance biodiversity, compensating for any removals (Document 21).

Overall, the project brief outlines a commitment to biodiversity conservation, particularly for vulnerable species like bats and butternut trees, through targeted actions and careful project planning.
