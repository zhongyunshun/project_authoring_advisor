The key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives, as outlined in the "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final," include:

1. **Factor of Safety (FOS)**: All conceptual stabilization options were developed based on a requested FOS of 1.3. This factor is crucial for ensuring the stability and safety of the slope.

2. **Evaluation of Alternatives**: The alternatives were assessed based on feasibility, constructability, and cost. Different options were compared to identify which would best meet the projectâ€™s needs while being practical and financially viable.

3. **Geotechnical Conditions**: The existing subsurface conditions of the slope, including the composition of earth materials (very loose to compact/soft to stiff earth fill materials), played a significant role in determining the approach for stabilization.

4. **Regulatory and Environmental Considerations**: Compliance with the TRCA's guidelines and environmental assessment requirements influenced the choice of alternatives, ensuring that the selected method would minimize environmental impact.

5. **Public Safety**: Any potential risks to public safety, particularly concerning the vicinity of the slope and any public infrastructure, were factored into the decision-making process.

These considerations helped guide the selection of the preferred alternative, which was determined to be a Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) structure, as it met the project objectives effectively while addressing safety and environmental concerns.
