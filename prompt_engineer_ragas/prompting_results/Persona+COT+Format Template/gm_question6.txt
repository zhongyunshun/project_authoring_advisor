The erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park involves a comprehensive approach that takes into account not only the physical environment but also the social impacts on access to parklands and community recreational spaces. 

According to the TRCA's documentation regarding the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project, one of the secondary objectives is to enhance surrounding terrestrial and aquatic habitats while preserving public enjoyment of the natural space. This indicates a commitment to maintaining recreational access even as infrastructure protection measures are implemented (Document 3).

The project aims to address erosion issues that threaten public safety and infrastructure, which can impact access to trails and park areas. Safety features, such as fencing and controlled access during construction, are planned to minimize disruption to park users (Document 7). Additionally, the project includes opportunities for habitat improvement, which can provide long-term benefits for the community by enhancing the natural environment and recreational value of the park (Document 18).

In summary, while the primary focus is on managing erosion and protecting infrastructure, the project also actively considers the social dimensions by aiming to sustain access to recreational spaces and enhancing community enjoyment of the park (Documents 19 and 18).
