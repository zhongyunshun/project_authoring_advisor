The roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the Class Environmental Assessment (Class EA) for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project are outlined in the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP." Here's a summary based on the information retrieved:

1. **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA)**: The TRCA is responsible for the overall management of the Class EA process, ensuring that all regulatory requirements are met and that the project adheres to the Conservation Authorities Act. They conduct assessments, engage with the community, and implement the proposed stabilization measures.

2. **Public Stakeholders**: Community members, including homeowners and local groups, are notified and consulted throughout the Class EA process. Public notifications began with the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018, and continued through various stages of public consultation (Document 3, Page 48).

3. **Indigenous Communities**: Indigenous communities are recognized as important stakeholders, and efforts are made to engage them in the process to ensure their perspectives and rights are respected (Document 3, Page 48).

4. **Consultants and Contractors**: Various consultants may be involved in conducting studies and assessments related to environmental impacts, as well as designing and implementing the slope stabilization measures.

5. **Minister of the Environment**: In certain circumstances, the project may require referral to the Minister of the Environment for a decision, particularly if there are significant public concerns or environmental implications (Document 9, Page 49).

6. **Regulatory Bodies**: Other local or provincial regulatory bodies may also play a role in reviewing and approving various aspects of the project, ensuring compliance with environmental and safety regulations.

This multi-stakeholder approach is crucial for ensuring that the project is executed effectively while considering the interests and concerns of all involved parties.
