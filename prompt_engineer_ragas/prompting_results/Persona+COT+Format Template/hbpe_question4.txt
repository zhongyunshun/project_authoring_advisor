The roles and responsibilities of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and the City of Toronto in the maintenance and administration of Humber Bay Park East are detailed in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I." 

According to the document, the TRCA is primarily responsible for the overall management and maintenance of the park, particularly in relation to environmental conservation and shoreline protection. This includes the implementation of the maintenance project designed to protect and enhance the shoreline and aquatic habitats, as well as ensuring the safety and accessibility of park facilities.

On the other hand, the City of Toronto collaborates with the TRCA, particularly in aspects of park administration, public engagement, and integration of municipal services and infrastructure within the park. The City is involved in discussions regarding the development of habitat features and other park improvements, signifying a cooperative effort to enhance the park's ecological integrity and recreational value for the community.

For example, the TRCA is leading the technical aspects of the maintenance project, while the City contributes to community affairs and public accessibility considerations, ensuring the park meets the needs of its users.

This collaborative relationship exemplifies the commitment of both organizations to maintain Humber Bay Park East as a valuable natural resource and recreational space for the public.
