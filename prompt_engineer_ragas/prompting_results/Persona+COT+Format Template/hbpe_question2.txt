The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project, particularly in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II," outlines several impacts on local wildlife, specifically aquatic species. The project includes a comprehensive baseline inventory of the area's aquatic habitats and species, which is crucial for understanding these impacts.

1. **Aquatic Species Inventory**: The baseline inventory noted the presence of various fish species, including Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt, which were identified during monitoring at three stations. The project aims to minimize habitat alteration and loss during construction activities, as the area is home to both native and introduced species, including invasive ones like the Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) (Document 10).

2. **Aquatic Habitat Alteration**: The project documents indicate that protection structures were designed to limit disturbance to native materials along the shoreline, which is crucial for maintaining existing aquatic habitats. The evaluation of proposed structures considers the areas of fish habitat that may be altered or lost due to construction activities (Document 3, Document 13).

3. **Mitigation Measures**: The TRCA staff will implement mitigation measures to manage the impact on aquatic habitats throughout the project. This includes monitoring and potentially adjusting construction practices to minimize disruption to aquatic species (Document 7).

4. **Restoration and Planting Plans**: Following the completion of construction phases, restoration efforts, including planting native species, are planned to help reestablish the local ecosystem and support wildlife (Document 20).

In summary, while the project strives to protect and manage the aquatic habitats and species present in Humber Bay Park East, ongoing monitoring and mitigation efforts are essential to minimize any negative impacts during the construction phases.
