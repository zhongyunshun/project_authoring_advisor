The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project has several measures in place to address potential social impacts and ensure the safety of the local community. Here are key points regarding these aspects:

1. **Public Safety Considerations**: The project recognizes the potential risks to public safety, particularly along trails and slopes. It includes requirements for safety features such as safety fences to mitigate these risks. The impact to public safety is rated as low to moderate, indicating a proactive approach to safeguarding community members during and after construction (Document 3).

2. **Public Notifications and Consultation**: The project follows a Class Environmental Assessment process, which involves public notifications and consultations. The first point of public contact occurred with a Notice of Intent published on November 22, 2018, and notices were sent to community groups and homeowners in the vicinity. This ensures that the local community is informed and can participate in discussions about the project (Document 18).

3. **Access and Pedestrian Traffic Management**: The construction will temporarily restrict pedestrian traffic along an active paved pathway that runs through the parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent. This measure is intended to maintain safety during the construction period (Document 9).

4. **Community Impact Assessments**: The project assesses potential impacts on existing infrastructure and surrounding community dynamics. Notably, there are no existing tourism operations affected by the project, which minimizes disruption to local economic activities (Document 7).

5. **Long-term Stability Considerations**: The project aims to ensure long-term slope stability to protect nearby properties and infrastructure, thus addressing concerns related to property safety and community well-being in the long run (Document 5).

Overall, the project incorporates safety features and community engagement strategies to address social impacts and ensure the safety of residents during the slope stabilization efforts.
