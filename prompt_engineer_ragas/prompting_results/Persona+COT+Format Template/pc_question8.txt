#### The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" outlines several long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies to ensure the durability and effectiveness of the implemented slope stabilization measures. Key strategies include:

1. **Periodic Inspections**: Regular assessments of the slope stabilization structures to identify any signs of distress or failure.
   
2. **Maintenance of Vegetation**: Initial periodic maintenance of vegetation is required during the first couple of years to ensure it becomes well established. This helps to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion.

3. **Sediment Control Measures**: Throughout construction, sediment control measures such as fencing will be put in place to prevent the entry of harmful substances into the nearby watercourses, which will also be maintained during the duration of the project.

4. **Monitoring of Environmental Impact**: Continuous evaluation of the ecological impacts of the stabilization measures to ensure they align with environmental standards and minimize harm to local habitats.

5. **Public Safety Measures**: Implementation of safety features, including safety fences, to mitigate risks to the public along trails and the slope.

These strategies are designed to maintain the integrity of the slope stabilization project over the long term, ensuring both public safety and environmental protection.
