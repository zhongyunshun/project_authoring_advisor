The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several measures to protect and minimize disruption to local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory. Here are some key strategies outlined in the technical documents:

1. **Baseline Inventory and Monitoring**: A thorough baseline inventory has been conducted to identify and understand the local aquatic species present in the area. This includes monitoring fish populations with three monitoring stations where species such as Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt have been observed (Document 1).

2. **Aquatic Habitat Considerations**: The design of protection structures along the shoreline considers the potential contamination of native material, aiming to minimize cutting and disturbance to these areas. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of aquatic habitats (Document 2).

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Prior to construction, measures such as the installation of silt socks will be implemented to prevent debris and pollutants from entering watercourses. This helps safeguard aquatic habitats from harmful substances during construction (Documents 8 and 9).

4. **Mitigation of Construction Impacts**: The project includes strategies to mitigate vibrations from construction activities, which can disturb aquatic species. Continuous monitoring will be conducted to assess the impact of construction on local wildlife (Document 4).

5. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After the completion of the project, the site will be subjected to inspections, especially following major storm events, to ensure that the implemented works remain stable and do not adversely affect aquatic habitats over time (Document 22).

These measures collectively aim to ensure the protection of local wildlife and aquatic ecosystems while facilitating necessary maintenance and improvements within Humber Bay Park East.
