The engagement of Indigenous communities in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project involved several key steps as outlined in the technical documents from the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). 

1. **Indigenous Community Consultation**: A full record of Indigenous community consultation, including all correspondence, is documented in the "Record of Indigenous Engagement for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project" found in Appendix D of the project plan. This indicates a structured approach to involving Indigenous communities from the outset.

2. **Notification and Initial Contact**: The first point of public contact, which included Indigenous communities, occurred with the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018. Notifications were sent to community groups and homeowners near the project site as well as to various Indigenous communities, including Beausoleil First Nation, Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, and others (Document 2, Document 3).

3. **Discussion of Concerns**: During the engagement process, the TRCA documented discussions regarding public and Indigenous community concerns. Notably, the project did not encounter any major concerns from the public, and specific feedback from Indigenous groups was collected and addressed (Document 1).

4. **Feedback Mechanism**: A Community Liaison Committee (CLC) meeting was held to provide a forum for residents and stakeholders to ask questions about the proposed erosion control and slope stabilization works. Comment forms were distributed to ensure that the community’s understanding of the project was captured and considered (Document 19).

5. **Outcomes of Engagement**: While specific outcomes from the Indigenous engagement process are not detailed in the documents, the acknowledgment of their involvement suggests that their input was valued in shaping the project’s approach and implementation.

In summary, the TRCA engaged Indigenous communities through notifications, formal meetings, and feedback mechanisms, ensuring that their voices were included in the planning process for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project.
