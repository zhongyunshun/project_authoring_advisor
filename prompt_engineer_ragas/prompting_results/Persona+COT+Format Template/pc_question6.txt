The anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project are primarily related to potential effects on wildlife, vegetation, and the surrounding community. Here’s how the project addresses these impacts:

### Environmental Impacts
1. **Wildlife and Habitat**: The project’s environmental assessment indicates that there are no significant wildlife populations within the project limits, which suggests limited anticipated impacts on wildlife (Document 9). However, there are wetland vegetation communities observed along the southern limits of the project area, which necessitates careful consideration during construction (Document 9).

2. **Vegetation**: Efforts will be made to minimize impacts on existing vegetation. The project plans to have the smallest construction footprint possible and to schedule activities outside of critical migration and breeding windows to protect habitat (Document 18).

3. **Erosion and Slope Stability**: The project aims to mitigate risks from valley slope erosion that could affect human life and property. This is critical as urban land use surrounding the site influences erosion rates (Document 19).

### Social Impacts
1. **Public Safety**: The project includes considerations for public safety, particularly concerning potential risks along trails and slopes. The implementation of safety features such as fences is anticipated (Document 11).

2. **Community Engagement**: The project has followed the Class Environmental Assessment process, with public notifications and consultations initiated as early as November 22, 2018. Notices were sent to community groups, homeowners in the vicinity, and Indigenous communities to keep them informed and involved (Document 4).

3. **Accessibility**: Two potential access routes have been proposed to ensure that the project site remains accessible while minimizing disruption to the surrounding area (Document 6).

### Addressing Impacts
The project plan includes a comprehensive restoration plan post-construction, which is aimed at rehabilitating any disturbed areas and ensuring that the ecological integrity of the site is maintained (Document 18). The selected construction alternatives are designed to reduce impacts on the environment while achieving the project's objectives of risk mitigation and long-term stability (Document 8).

In summary, the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" outlines a multifaceted approach to addressing both environmental and social impacts through careful planning, community engagement, and a focus on minimizing disturbances.
