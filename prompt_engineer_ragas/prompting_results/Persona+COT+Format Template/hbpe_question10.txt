The restoration plantings described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" contribute to mitigating biodiversity loss by focusing on the replanting of suitable native species. This approach is essential for enhancing the local ecosystem's resilience and diversity, particularly concerning species at risk. 

In the project, a commitment has been made to plant a significant number of trees, with preliminary plans indicating the on-site planting of 280 trees during Phase I. This is aimed at compensating for habitat disturbance due to construction activities and restoring ecological functions (Document 3, Page 35). The project also emphasizes the removal of invasive species, which can negatively impact native biodiversity. By replacing these with native plantings, the overall biodiversity of the project area can be enhanced (Document 19, Page 188).

Moreover, the restoration activities are designed to follow TRCAâ€™s guidelines, which advocate for a replication ratio that ensures adequate compensation for any tree removals. For example, it is noted that 92 trees and 2,291 shrubs are anticipated to be planted during site restoration to compensate for removals (Document 7, Page 9). This proactive approach is crucial in supporting and improving habitat conditions for species at risk, thus contributing positively to the regional biodiversity.

In summary, the restoration efforts outlined in the HBPE Project Brief are structured to not only compensate for environmental impacts but also to enhance overall biodiversity and support the recovery of at-risk species through thoughtful planting and habitat improvement strategies.
