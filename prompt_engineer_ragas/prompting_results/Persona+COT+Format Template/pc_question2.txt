The Ecology Survey conducted for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project outlined several measures aimed at mitigating impacts on local wildlife, particularly given the context of species identified in the vicinity. Here are the key proposed measures:

1. **Minimizing Construction Footprint**: All construction activities are planned to have the smallest possible construction footprint to reduce disturbance to existing natural habitats. This approach is intended to minimize impacts on local wildlife and vegetation communities (Document 3, page 26).

2. **Timing of Construction Activities**: Construction will occur outside of key migration and breeding windows when wildlife habitat use is critical. This scheduling is designed to avoid disrupting breeding bird activities and other sensitive wildlife periods (Document 18, page 27).

3. **Selective Tree Removal**: While there may be some removal of select canopy trees, the intent is to ensure that these actions lead to only minimal impacts on bird habitat. The selected trees will be those that do not significantly contribute to the overall ecological integrity of the area (Document 18, page 27).

4. **Restoration Plans**: A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented following construction to enhance and restore habitats that may be affected by the project (Document 3, page 26).

5. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring will occur to assess the effects of the project on wildlife and to ensure that any unforeseen impacts can be addressed promptly (implied within the scope of environmental assessments).

These measures reflect TRCA's commitment to balancing necessary construction activities with the preservation of local wildlife and habitats. If you need further details or specific information about particular species, please let me know!
