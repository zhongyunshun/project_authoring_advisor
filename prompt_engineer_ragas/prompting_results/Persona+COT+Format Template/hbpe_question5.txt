The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is structured into three distinct phases for design and implementation. 

1. **Phase I**: This phase has already been initiated and involves preliminary work such as site setup, tree removal, and construction of temporary structures.

2. **Phase II**: Currently in progress, this phase focuses on the Western Headland. It includes major maintenance activities aimed at ensuring long-term shoreline stability and ecological restoration. 

3. **Phase III**: Planned for the future, this phase is expected to involve further enhancements, including the placement of beach material and additional restoration efforts. These activities will follow the completion of Phase II and will focus on the continuation of shoreline protection and habitat restoration.

Restoration plantings are planned to occur after the completion of all three phases, with some preliminary restoration expected along the Eastern Headland following Phase II's completion (source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase II, pages 24 & 35).
