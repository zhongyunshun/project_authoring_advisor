The selection of different erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and gravel beaches, in the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief" was based on their effectiveness in addressing erosion concerns and their environmental impact. 

1. **Armourstone Headlands**: The concept design for the eastern armourstone headland (WF11.12) included considerations such as visible displacement of material and backshore erosion, which were documented in the project brief. The structures were chosen to provide stability and mitigate erosion, particularly in areas with high wave action. The design aimed to enhance structural integrity while minimizing environmental disruption.

2. **Gravel/Cobble Beaches**: The concept for the cobble/gravel beach (WF11.11) also took into account the existing conditions, including visible scouring and undercutting. The choice of material size and quantity was influenced by the need for both user-friendliness and sufficient shoreline protection. Smaller cobble sizes, while more appealing for park users, required greater material quantities and had higher costs associated with maintenance.

3. **Environmental Considerations**: The documents highlight a careful balance between structural effectiveness and environmental impact. For instance, designs aimed to minimize excavation and disturbance to native materials, which helps preserve existing habitats while providing necessary erosion control.

Overall, the selection process involved assessing the condition of existing structures, understanding the site-specific erosion dynamics, and considering user experience and ecological impacts.
