The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" for the newly installed erosion control measures include:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter. This is to ensure that the implemented erosion control measures are stable and performing as designed. Any maintenance required will be addressed promptly (Document 1, page 36).

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Prior to the start of construction, staging and stockpiling areas are isolated with standard silt socks to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse. Damaged erosion and sediment control measures should be repaired or replaced within 48 hours of inspection (Documents 4 and 5, pages 32 and 4 respectively).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring during and after construction will help ensure that all best management practices are followed to minimize environmental disturbance. This includes keeping all erosion and sediment control measures effective until the site is fully re-vegetated (Document 15, page 45).

4. **Restoration Plantings and Vegetation Monitoring**: The monitoring includes a record of photographs and monitoring of proposed vegetation for two years after planting to ensure survivability (Document 7, page 5). 

These strategies are crucial for maintaining the effectiveness of the erosion control measures and ensuring the ecological integrity of the project area over time.
