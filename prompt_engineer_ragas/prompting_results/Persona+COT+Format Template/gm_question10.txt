The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project includes specified tree removals and restoration plantings aimed at mitigating biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk such as butternut trees and bats.

1. **Tree Removals**: The project necessitates the removal of approximately 180 trees, with an additional 38 trees expected to be injured (TRCA, 2021-09-29). While this may seem detrimental to local biodiversity, the removals are planned to be highly selective and targeted to minimize overall impact. The project is designed to occur outside of significant ecological periods, such as bird breeding seasons, to further reduce potential negative impacts on wildlife (TRCA, 2021-09-29).

2. **Restoration Plantings**: Following the tree removals, a comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented. This plan emphasizes planting suitable native species that are expected to provide increased soil stabilization, reduce erosion, and enhance local biodiversity once established (TRCA, 2019-09-26). The focus on native species is crucial for supporting local ecosystems and species at risk.

3. **Species at Risk**: Butternut trees, which are classified as an endangered species under Ontario's Endangered Species Act, are specifically mentioned in the project documents. Genetic testing has confirmed that the butternuts in the area are genetically pure, making their protection vital (TRCA, 2019-09-26). Retaining these trees, when feasible, and minimizing impacts through careful planning and restoration efforts are critical for their recovery.

4. **Mitigation Strategies**: The project also includes strategies to mitigate impacts on wildlife, such as conducting construction activities outside of key migration and breeding windows. This approach is particularly important for bats and other wildlife that may be affected by habitat alterations (TRCA, 2019-09-26).

In summary, while the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project involves tree removals, it concurrently incorporates restoration efforts that aim to enhance biodiversity and protect species at risk. This dual approach seeks to balance necessary infrastructure improvements with ecological stewardship.
