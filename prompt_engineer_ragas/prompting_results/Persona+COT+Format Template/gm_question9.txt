In the development and implementation of TRCA projects like those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay, local Indigenous communities are consulted through a structured engagement process. This process is designed to ensure meaningful participation and respect for the interests of Indigenous groups that may be affected by TRCA projects.

1. **Indigenous Engagement Process**: TRCA recognizes the importance of consulting with Aboriginal communities regarding planning matters that may affect their rights and interests. This engagement takes different forms based on the community and the specific project. The aim is to provide Indigenous communities with opportunities to receive information about the project and offer input, while also allowing TRCA to identify their interests and concerns (Document 3).

2. **Summary of Consultation Activities**: For instance, in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, a variety of Indigenous groups were engaged, including the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation and Six Nations of the Grand River. Communication methods included notices sent via courier and email, and the process involved preliminary consultations and follow-ups to ensure ongoing dialogue (Documents 17 and 19).

3. **Documentation and Record Keeping**: TRCA maintains a record of all consultations, including correspondence with Indigenous communities, to ensure transparency and accountability in the engagement process (Document 13).

4. **Culturally Sensitive Considerations**: TRCA acknowledges the presence of overlapping traditional territories and Treaty areas within its jurisdiction, which necessitates a careful approach to consultation, especially concerning archaeological sites and cultural heritage (Document 11).

By integrating these practices, TRCA aims to foster a cooperative relationship with Indigenous communities, ensuring that their voices are heard in the planning and execution of projects that impact their lands and interests.
