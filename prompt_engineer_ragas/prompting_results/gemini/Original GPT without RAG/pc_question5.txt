To accurately answer your question, I need access to the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief". I do not have the ability to access external files or websites.

Therefore, I cannot determine if any future plans or subsequent phases for slope stabilization are mentioned within that specific document.

To find the answer, you would need to:

1.  **Locate the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" document.**
