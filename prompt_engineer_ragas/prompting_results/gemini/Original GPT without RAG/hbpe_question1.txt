I need the "Design Brief - Phase II" document to answer your question. I do not have access to external files or specific documents.

However, I can tell you the *types* of engineering challenges and considerations that are *likely* to have been addressed during the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East. These are common for shoreline protection projects:

**Likely Engineering Challenges and Considerations:**

*   **Wave Action and Erosion:**
    *   **Wave Climate Analysis:** Understanding the frequency, height, and direction of waves impacting the shoreline. This is crucial for determining the required size and type of protection.
    *   **Erosion Rates:** Assessing existing and predicted erosion rates to determine the extent of protection needed and the lifespan of the structure.
    *   **Scour:** Preventing scour (erosion) at the base of the protection structure due to wave action and currents.
    *   **Storm Surge and Sea Level Rise:** Factoring in the potential impact of storm surges and long-term sea level rise on the performance and longevity of the protection.

*   **Geotechnical Conditions:**
    *   **Soil Stability:** Analyzing the soil composition and stability of the existing shoreline to ensure the foundation for the protection structure is adequate.
    *   **Settlement:** Predicting and mitigating potential settlement of the protection structure over time.
    *   **Groundwater:** Assessing groundwater levels and their potential impact on the stability and performance of the protection structure.

*   **Hydraulic Performance:**
    *   **Drainage:** Ensuring adequate drainage behind the protection structure to prevent hydrostatic pressure buildup.
    *   **Wave Reflection:** Minimizing wave reflection from the protection structure to avoid negative impacts on adjacent shorelines or navigation.
    *   **Current Patterns:** Understanding and mitigating the impact of the protection structure on existing current patterns.

*   **Structural Design:**
    *   **Material Selection:** Choosing appropriate materials (e.g., rock, concrete, steel, timber) based on durability, cost, environmental impact, and aesthetic considerations.
    *   **Structural Stability:** Designing the protection structure to withstand wave forces, ice loading (if applicable), and other environmental loads.
    *   **Longevity and Maintenance:** Designing for a specified lifespan and considering ease of maintenance and repair.

*   **Environmental Considerations:**
    *   **Habitat Protection:** Minimizing the impact on existing aquatic and terrestrial habitats.
    *   **Water Quality:** Preventing pollution and maintaining water quality during construction and operation.
    *   **Fish Passage:** Ensuring fish passage along the shoreline.
    *   **Sediment Transport:** Minimizing disruption to natural sediment transport processes.
    *   **Aesthetics:** Designing the protection structure to be visually appealing and blend in with the surrounding environment.

*   **Construction Considerations:**
    *   **Accessibility:** Ensuring access for construction equipment and materials.
    *   **Construction Methods:** Selecting appropriate construction methods that minimize environmental impact and disruption to public access.
    *   **Cost:** Optimizing the design to minimize construction costs while meeting performance requirements.
    *   **Schedule:** Developing a realistic construction schedule.

*   **Regulatory Compliance:**
    *   **Permitting:** Obtaining all necessary permits from local, provincial, and federal agencies.
    *   **Environmental Regulations:** Complying with all applicable environmental regulations.

**Specific to Humber Bay Park East, the document likely addressed:**

*   **The specific type of shoreline (e.g., bluff, beach, artificial embankment).**
*   **The existing park infrastructure and how the shoreline protection would integrate with it.**
*   **The recreational use of the park and how the shoreline protection would affect it.**
*   **The viewshed and how the shoreline protection would impact views of Lake Ontario and the Toronto skyline.**
