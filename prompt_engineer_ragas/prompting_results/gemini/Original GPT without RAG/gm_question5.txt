I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding future phases or expansions for the erosion control and slope stabilization efforts at Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent without access to project documents, official statements from the City of Toronto (or relevant governing body), or news reports specifically addressing future plans.

To find this information, I recommend the following:

*   **Search the City of Toronto's website:** Look for project pages, environmental assessment reports, capital works plans, or official news releases related to Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent.
*   **Contact the City of Toronto directly:** Contact the Parks, Forestry and Recreation department or the relevant engineering department for information about future plans.
*   **Search local news archives:** Search for news articles about the projects to see if any future phases or expansions have been mentioned.
*   **Consult project documentation:** If you have access to any project reports, environmental impact assessments, or other documentation, review those for any information about planned future phases.
