Unfortunately, I do not have access to specific documents like the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I." Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer on the roles and responsibilities of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and the City of Toronto in the maintenance and administration of Humber Bay Park East as described in that particular document.

However, I can offer some general information based on my knowledge of how TRCA and the City of Toronto typically interact in park management and what their likely roles *could* be:

**Likely Roles and Responsibilities (General, not specific to the document):**

**Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA):**

*   **Conservation Authority Role:** TRCA is mandated to protect and enhance the natural environment within its jurisdiction, which includes the Humber River watershed and likely covers Humber Bay Park East.
*   **Flood Management:** TRCA is responsible for flood control and management. Given Humber Bay Park East's location on the waterfront, this is likely a key area of TRCA's involvement. They might be responsible for infrastructure related to flood protection, erosion control, and water level management.
*   **Environmental Protection and Restoration:** TRCA could be responsible for ecological restoration projects within the park. This might involve habitat creation, invasive species management, shoreline stabilization, and water quality monitoring.
*   **Permitting and Regulations:** TRCA likely has a role in issuing permits for any construction or development activities within the park that could impact the natural environment.
*   **Land Ownership/Management (Possible):** In some cases, TRCA owns or manages land within a park. They *might* own some portions of Humber Bay Park East, which would give them direct control over those areas.
*   **Consultation and Partnership:** TRCA likely collaborates with the City of Toronto on park management decisions to ensure alignment with conservation goals.

**City of Toronto:**

*   **Park Management:** The City of Toronto Parks, Forestry & Recreation division is generally responsible for the day-to-day management and maintenance of city parks.
*   **Maintenance:** This includes grass cutting, garbage collection, trail maintenance, playground maintenance, washroom cleaning, and general upkeep of park amenities.
*   **Recreation Programs:** The City typically runs recreational programs and events within parks.
*   **Infrastructure Maintenance:** The City is likely responsible for maintaining non-flood control related infrastructure, such as pathways, benches, lighting, and playgrounds.
*   **Capital Improvements:** The City would likely lead capital improvement projects, such as building new structures or upgrading existing facilities.
*   **Enforcement:** City by-law officers are responsible for enforcing park rules and regulations.
*   **Community Engagement:** The City often engages with the local community on park planning and management issues.

**How the Roles Might Interact (Based on General Knowledge):**

*   **Shared Responsibility:** The maintenance and administration of Humber Bay Park East is likely a shared responsibility between TRCA and the City of Toronto.
*   **Agreement:** There is likely a formal agreement outlining the specific responsibilities of each organization. This agreement might cover things like funding, maintenance schedules, and decision-making processes.
*   **TRCA focuses on environmental aspects:** TRCA would likely focus on the environmental aspects of the park, while the City would focus on the recreational and operational aspects.
*   **Consultation:** The two organizations would likely consult with each other on any major decisions affecting the park.

**To get the specific information you need, you would need to:**

*   **Access the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" document.** This document should clearly outline the roles and responsibilities of TRCA and the City of Toronto. You might be able to find it on the City of Toronto's or TRCA's website, or by contacting either organization directly.
*   **Contact the City of Toronto Parks, Forestry & Recreation division or the TRCA directly.** They can provide you with information about their specific roles and responsibilities in the management of Humber Bay Park East.

Without access to the specific document, I can only provide general information. I apologize that I cannot give you a more precise answer.
