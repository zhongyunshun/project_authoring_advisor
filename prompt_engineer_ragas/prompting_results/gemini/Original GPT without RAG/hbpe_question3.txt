Information on the specific sustainable development practices implemented in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project is not readily available through a general web search. Public information about such projects often doesn't go into granular detail about specific sustainability practices.

To find this information, you would likely need to:

1.  **Consult the City of Toronto's website:** Look for project documents related to the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project. Search for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), sustainability plans, or project updates. These documents may detail specific practices.  Search terms like "Humber Bay Park East Maintenance Sustainability," "Humber Bay Park East Environmental Assessment," or "Humber Bay Park East Rehabilitation Project" may be helpful.

2.  **Contact the City of Toronto directly:** Reach out to the City's Parks, Forestry & Recreation department or the project managers for the Humber Bay Park East project. They should be able to provide you with specific information about the sustainable development practices being used.

3.  **Search for news articles or press releases:** Local news outlets or environmental organizations might have reported on the project and its sustainability initiatives.

4.  **Look for documentation related to the Environmental Assessment process:** If the project required an Environmental Assessment, that documentation would contain detailed information about the environmental considerations and mitigation strategies, including sustainable practices.

Without access to these specific resources, I can only offer general examples of sustainable development practices that *might* be used in such a project:

*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Implementing measures to prevent soil erosion and sediment runoff into Lake Ontario during construction, such as silt fences, erosion control blankets, and sediment basins.

*   **Habitat Protection:** Minimizing disturbance to existing vegetation and wildlife habitats.  This could involve protecting mature trees, creating buffer zones, and implementing construction timing restrictions to avoid sensitive periods for wildlife (e.g., bird nesting season).

*   **Native Plant Revegetation:** Using native plant species for landscaping and restoration efforts. Native plants are better adapted to the local environment and provide habitat for native wildlife.

*   **Water Conservation:** Using water-efficient irrigation systems or drought-tolerant plants in landscaping.

*   **Waste Management:** Implementing a comprehensive waste management plan to minimize construction waste and maximize recycling.

*   **Sustainable Materials:** Using recycled or locally sourced materials in construction, such as recycled concrete or wood.

*   **Energy Efficiency:** Using energy-efficient equipment and practices during construction.

*   **Pollution Control:** Implementing measures to minimize air and noise pollution during construction.

*   **Stormwater Management:** Designing the project to effectively manage stormwater runoff and reduce the risk of flooding. This could involve creating permeable surfaces or installing rain gardens.

*   **Soil Health:** Considering soil health and compaction during and after construction.

*   **Community Engagement:** Engaging with the local community to gather input on the project and address their concerns related to sustainability.
