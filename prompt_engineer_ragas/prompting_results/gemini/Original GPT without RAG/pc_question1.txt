I do not have access to specific Slope Stability and Erosion Risk Assessment documents, including one related to "Peacham Crescent projects." Therefore, I cannot provide you with a definition of "Long-Term Stable Slope Crests" (LTSSC) as used in that specific context, nor can I tell you the exact criteria used to determine them.

However, I can give you a **general overview** of what LTSSC likely means in the context of slope stability and erosion risk assessments, and the types of criteria typically used to assess slope crest stability:

**General Understanding of Long-Term Stable Slope Crests (LTSSC):**

In general, a Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC) refers to the **upper edge of a slope that is expected to remain in a stable condition for an extended period (often decades or more) without significant erosion, instability, or retreat.** The "long-term" aspect is crucial, distinguishing it from short-term stability which might only consider immediate conditions.

**Why are Slope Crests Important?**

*   **Stability Impact:** Failure at the crest can initiate larger slope failures downslope.
*   **Land Use:** The crest is often where development or infrastructure is located, making its stability critical for property protection and safety.
*   **Erosion Source:** An unstable crest is a primary source of sediment and debris that can contribute to erosion and sedimentation problems downslope.

**Typical Criteria Used to Determine LTSSC:**

While the specific criteria would vary based on the project, site conditions, and regulatory requirements, here's a list of factors commonly considered:

1.  **Factor of Safety (FoS):**  This is a fundamental concept in slope stability analysis. A FoS greater than 1.5 is often considered acceptable for long-term stability in many jurisdictions.  The FoS is calculated using geotechnical engineering principles and software, considering:
    *   **Shear Strength Parameters:** The soil's or rock's ability to resist shearing (friction angle and cohesion). These are typically determined through laboratory testing (e.g., direct shear tests, triaxial tests) and/or back-analysis of existing slopes.
    *   **Soil/Rock Properties:** Unit weight, density, permeability, and other relevant properties.
    *   **Groundwater Conditions:** The level of the water table significantly impacts slope stability. Pore water pressure reduces the effective stress and thus the shear strength.
    *   **Slope Geometry:**  Slope height and angle are critical factors.
    *   **External Loads:**  Any loads applied to the slope, such as buildings, roads, or stockpiles.
    *   **Seismic Loading:** In seismically active areas, the potential for earthquake-induced ground accelerations must be considered.

2.  **Erosion Potential:**  An assessment of the susceptibility of the crest to erosion by water and wind.  This includes:
    *   **Soil Type:**  Some soils are more erodible than others (e.g., silty soils are often highly erodible).
    *   **Vegetation Cover:**  Healthy vegetation protects the soil from erosion.  The type and density of vegetation are important.
    *   **Rainfall Intensity and Duration:**  The severity of rainfall events.
    *   **Surface Runoff:**  The amount and velocity of water flowing across the surface.
    *   **Wind Exposure:**  The degree to which the crest is exposed to wind.
    *   **Evidence of Past Erosion:**  Existing gullies, rills, or exposed roots.

3.  **Geomorphological Assessment:**  An understanding of the landforms and geological processes that have shaped the area.
    *   **Evidence of Past Slope Failures:**  Landslides, slumps, or debris flows in the vicinity.
    *   **Geological Structure:**  The presence of faults, folds, or bedding planes that could weaken the slope.
    *   **Weathering and Degradation:**  The degree to which the rock or soil has been broken down by weathering processes.

4.  **Groundwater Conditions:**  As mentioned above, groundwater plays a crucial role. Assessments would consider:
    *   **Depth to Water Table:**  Shallow water tables are generally less stable.
    *   **Groundwater Flow Patterns:**  The direction and rate of groundwater flow.
    *   **Seepage:**  The presence of water seeping from the slope face.

5.  **Vegetation Analysis:**  The type, density, and health of vegetation are important indicators of stability.
    *   **Root Strength:**  The ability of plant roots to reinforce the soil.
    *   **Surface Cover:**  The extent to which the ground surface is protected by vegetation.
    *   **Species Present:**  Some species are more effective at preventing erosion than others.

6.  **Human Activities:**  Activities that could impact slope stability, such as:
    *   **Excavation or Fill:**  Altering the slope geometry.
    *   **Vegetation Removal:**  Removing trees or other vegetation.
    *   **Construction:**  Adding loads to the slope.
    *   **Drainage Alterations:**  Changing the way water flows across the surface or through the ground.

**How These Criteria are Applied in Practice:**

*   **Geotechnical Investigations:**  Soil borings, test pits, and geophysical surveys are used to collect data on soil and rock properties.
*   **Stability Modeling:**  Computer models are used to simulate slope behavior and calculate the factor of safety under different conditions (e.g., different groundwater levels, seismic loading).  Common software includes SLOPE/W, GeoStudio, and PLAXIS.
*   **Erosion Modeling:**  Models like RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) can be used to estimate soil loss due to erosion.
*   **Visual Inspection:**  Experienced engineers and geologists visually inspect the slope for signs of instability or erosion.
*   **Monitoring:**  In some cases, slopes are monitored using instruments such as inclinometers (to measure ground movement) and piezometers (to measure groundwater levels).

**To find the *specific* definition and criteria used for the Peacham Crescent projects, you need to consult the actual Slope Stability and Erosion Risk Assessment documents prepared for those projects. Look for sections specifically defining LTSSC and outlining the methodology used to assess slope stability and erosion risk.** You might find these documents at:

*   The project developer or owner.
*   The local municipality or government agency responsible for permitting and land use regulations.
*   The engineering firm that conducted the assessment.
