The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project is likely implementing a range of measures to protect local wildlife, especially aquatic species. While I don't have access to real-time project updates or specific details for this particular project, here's a breakdown of the types of measures that are typically taken in similar projects, based on standard environmental best practices and regulations:

**1. Pre-Construction Planning and Assessment:**

*   **Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA):** A thorough EIA should have been conducted to identify potential impacts on wildlife and their habitats. This assessment informs the development of mitigation measures.
*   **Baseline Inventory:** As you mentioned, a baseline inventory of species present in the area (particularly aquatic species) is crucial. This identifies sensitive species and habitats. The inventory helps determine appropriate mitigation strategies.
*   **Permits and Approvals:** Obtaining necessary permits from relevant regulatory bodies (e.g., Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, Environment Canada, local conservation authorities) ensures compliance with environmental regulations. These permits often stipulate specific protective measures.
*   **Timing Restrictions:** Work is often scheduled to avoid sensitive periods for wildlife, such as breeding seasons, spawning seasons, and migration periods. This minimizes disturbance to vulnerable life stages.

**2. Habitat Protection and Mitigation:**

*   **Sediment and Erosion Control:** Strict measures are implemented to prevent sediment runoff into the water. This is critical to protect aquatic habitats and water quality. Common methods include silt fences, turbidity curtains, and stabilized construction entrances.
*   **Buffer Zones:** Establishing buffer zones around sensitive habitats (e.g., wetlands, shorelines) restricts construction activity and minimizes disturbance.
*   **Fish Salvage and Relocation:** If fish are likely to be impacted by the project (e.g., during dewatering or in-water work), a fish salvage and relocation program may be implemented. Qualified biologists capture and relocate fish to suitable habitat outside the construction zone.
*   **Habitat Restoration:** Following construction, impacted habitats may be restored or enhanced to compensate for any losses. This could include planting native vegetation, creating artificial wetlands, or improving fish habitat.
*   **Water Quality Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of water quality (e.g., turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen) is conducted to ensure that construction activities are not negatively impacting aquatic life.
*   **Minimizing In-Water Work:** Efforts are made to minimize the amount of in-water work required. If in-water work is unavoidable, it is often conducted using methods that minimize disturbance to the surrounding environment.
*   **Containment Measures:** For any activities that could release pollutants (e.g., fuel spills), containment measures are in place to prevent them from entering the water. Spill response plans are also developed and implemented.

**3. Wildlife Disturbance Minimization:**

*   **Noise Reduction:** Measures are taken to minimize noise pollution, which can disturb wildlife. This could include using quieter equipment, installing noise barriers, and limiting the duration of noisy activities.
*   **Light Management:** Light pollution can also disrupt wildlife behavior. Light levels are minimized, and shielded lighting is used to direct light downwards and away from sensitive habitats.
*   **Vegetation Protection:** Existing vegetation is protected as much as possible. Trees and shrubs are fenced off to prevent damage from construction equipment.
*   **Wildlife Exclusion:** Fencing or other barriers may be used to prevent wildlife from entering the construction zone.
*   **Worker Education:** Construction workers are educated about the importance of protecting wildlife and the specific measures that are in place to minimize impacts. They are also trained to identify and report any wildlife encounters.

**4. Monitoring and Adaptive Management:**

*   **Environmental Monitoring:** Ongoing monitoring of water quality, wildlife populations, and habitat conditions is conducted to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures.
*   **Adaptive Management:** If monitoring reveals that mitigation measures are not working as intended, they are adjusted to improve their effectiveness. This adaptive management approach ensures that the project is continuously improving its environmental performance.
*   **Reporting:** Regular reports are submitted to regulatory agencies documenting the project's environmental performance and compliance with permit conditions.

**How to Find More Specific Information:**

To get specific details about the measures being taken in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, I recommend the following:

*   **Consult the Project's Environmental Assessment Report:** This document should outline the potential impacts of the project and the mitigation measures that will be implemented. These reports are often available online through the City of Toronto's website or the relevant Conservation Authority.
*   **Contact the City of Toronto's Parks, Forestry and Recreation Department:** They should be able to provide information about the project and the environmental protection measures that are being implemented.
*   **Contact the Project Contractor:** The contractor responsible for the project will have detailed knowledge of the environmental protection measures that are being implemented.
*   **Contact the Relevant Conservation Authority:** The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) may have information about the project and its potential impacts on the environment.

By consulting these sources, you should be able to obtain detailed information about the specific measures being taken to protect wildlife during the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project.
