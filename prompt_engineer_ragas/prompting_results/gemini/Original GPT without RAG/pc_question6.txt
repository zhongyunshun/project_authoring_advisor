To answer this question, I need access to the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" document. Since I cannot directly access external files or the internet, I can only provide a *general* answer based on common environmental and social impacts associated with slope stabilization projects and typical mitigation strategies found in Environmental Assessments (EAs).

**General Anticipated Environmental and Social Impacts of Slope Stabilization Projects:**

**Environmental Impacts:**

*   **Water Quality:** Increased sedimentation and turbidity in nearby water bodies due to soil disturbance during construction. Potential for runoff containing pollutants (e.g., from machinery, concrete).
*   **Air Quality:** Dust generation during excavation and construction activities. Emissions from construction equipment.
*   **Habitat Loss & Disturbance:** Removal of vegetation and disturbance to wildlife habitats in the project area. Impacts on sensitive species (e.g., nesting birds, endangered plants). Fragmentation of wildlife corridors.
*   **Soil Erosion:** Increased erosion potential in disturbed areas before stabilization measures are fully implemented.
*   **Noise Pollution:** Noise from construction equipment affecting nearby residents and wildlife.
*   **Visual Impacts:** Changes to the landscape due to the stabilization structure itself (e.g., retaining walls, terracing).
*   **Impacts on Wetlands/Watercourses:** Potential alteration or destruction of wetlands or watercourses if they are located in the project area.
*   **Geomorphology:** Alteration of natural slope processes and potentially affecting downstream areas.

**Social Impacts:**

*   **Traffic Disruptions:** Road closures or traffic delays during construction.
*   **Noise and Vibration:** Disturbance to nearby residents from construction activities.
*   **Aesthetic Impacts:** Visual changes to the landscape affecting property values and quality of life.
*   **Recreational Impacts:** Temporary or permanent closure of recreational areas (e.g., trails, parks).
*   **Economic Impacts:** Both positive (e.g., job creation during construction, increased property values due to stabilized slopes) and negative (e.g., decreased property values during construction, loss of business due to traffic disruptions).
*   **Safety Concerns:** Potential hazards related to construction activities (e.g., falling debris, open excavations).
*   **Impacts on Cultural Heritage:** Disturbance to archaeological sites or culturally significant areas.
*   **Access to Properties:** Temporary or permanent changes to access to properties adjacent to the project area.

**How a Class EA PP (Project Proposal) typically addresses these impacts:**

A Class EA PP would typically include the following to address these impacts:

*   **Impact Identification and Assessment:** A detailed description of the potential environmental and social impacts of the project, based on site-specific conditions.
*   **Mitigation Measures:** Specific strategies to minimize or avoid the identified impacts. Examples:
    *   **Water Quality:** Implementing erosion and sediment control measures (e.g., silt fences, sediment basins), using best management practices for stormwater management, minimizing disturbance near watercourses.
    *   **Air Quality:** Using dust suppression techniques (e.g., watering), requiring construction equipment to meet emission standards.
    *   **Habitat Loss & Disturbance:** Minimizing the area of disturbance, replanting native vegetation, creating new habitat areas, avoiding construction during sensitive periods (e.g., nesting season).
    *   **Noise Pollution:** Using noise barriers, limiting construction hours, using quieter equipment.
    *   **Traffic Disruptions:** Developing a traffic management plan, providing advance notice of road closures, using detour routes.
    *   **Aesthetic Impacts:** Using natural materials for stabilization structures, landscaping to blend the structure into the surrounding environment.
    *   **Cultural Heritage:** Conducting archaeological assessments, implementing mitigation measures to protect any identified cultural heritage resources.
*   **Monitoring Plan:** A plan to monitor the effectiveness of the mitigation measures and to identify any unforeseen impacts.
*   **Public Consultation:** A process for engaging with the public and stakeholders to gather input on the project and to address any concerns. This might involve public meetings, online surveys, and other forms of communication.
*   **Alternatives Analysis:** Consideration of alternative slope stabilization methods and locations, and a justification for the selected approach.
*   **Contingency Plans:** Plans to address unexpected events, such as spills or the discovery of contaminated soil.

**Therefore, to specifically address your query:**

To get the definitive answer, you would need to review the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" document. Look for sections that specifically discuss environmental and social impacts, mitigation measures, monitoring plans, and public consultation. The document should detail *exactly* how the project aims to minimize negative impacts and maximize benefits for the environment and the community.
