#### The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" would need to be reviewed to provide a specific answer regarding future phases or expansions planned for Humber Bay Park East. I do not have access to specific documents or files. To find this information, you would need to:

1.  **Locate the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" document.** This might be available on the City of Toronto's website (if Humber Bay Park East is in Toronto), through local community groups involved in park planning, or through other relevant sources.

2.  **Carefully read the document.** Look for sections that discuss future phases, expansions, or long-term plans for the park. Pay attention to any diagrams or maps that might illustrate these plans.
