Unfortunately, I don't have access to specific documents or internal project plans for the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project. Therefore, I cannot provide you with the exact long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for that specific project.

However, I *can* give you a general overview of what monitoring and maintenance strategies are *typically* employed for erosion control measures in similar park and waterfront projects, based on best practices and common industry standards. This information should give you a good understanding of the types of measures likely implemented and what to look for if you are searching for the actual project documents.

**Common Long-Term Monitoring and Maintenance Strategies for Erosion Control:**

These strategies are often tailored to the specific erosion control techniques used (e.g., riprap, vegetation, retaining walls, breakwaters).

**1. Regular Visual Inspections:**

*   **Frequency:** Typically monthly for the first year after installation, then quarterly or semi-annually. Inspections are often increased after significant weather events (storms, heavy rainfall, high winds, ice thaw).
*   **What to Look For:**
    *   **Vegetation:** Health of planted vegetation (e.g., grass, shrubs, trees) â€“ signs of stress, disease, or die-off. Check for adequate density and coverage. Look for invasive species encroachment.
    *   **Riprap/Armour Stone:** Displacement of stones, settlement, undermining, evidence of wave action damage, loss of filter fabric.
    *   **Retaining Walls/Seawalls:** Cracking, tilting, bulging, settlement, joint deterioration, drainage issues, scour at the base.
    *   **Geotextiles/Filter Fabrics:** Exposure, tearing, clogging, displacement.
    *   **Breakwaters/Groins:** Settlement, damage from wave action or ice, undermining, gaps in the structure.
    *   **Sediment Accumulation:** Excessive sediment buildup in designed sediment traps or at the base of erosion control structures.  This can indicate a need for dredging or sediment removal.
    *   **Scour:** Evidence of erosion and removal of soil around structures, especially at the base.
    *   **Drainage:** Functionality of drainage systems (e.g., culverts, swales, ditches). Look for blockages, ponding, and signs of erosion.
    *   **Overall Stability:** Assess the overall stability of the shoreline and erosion control structures.

**2. Performance Monitoring:**

*   **Surveying:** Periodic surveys to monitor shoreline position, elevation changes, and the stability of structures. This can be done with traditional surveying methods or using drone imagery and photogrammetry.
*   **Sediment Transport Studies:** More complex projects might involve sediment transport studies to understand how sediment is moving along the shoreline and how the erosion control measures are affecting sediment deposition and erosion patterns.
*   **Water Quality Monitoring:** If the project involves vegetation or other natural erosion control methods, water quality monitoring might be conducted to assess the impact of the project on water quality.
*   **Photographic Documentation:** Regular photo documentation of the site to track changes over time.  "Before and after" photos are particularly useful.

**3. Maintenance Activities:**

*   **Vegetation Management:**
    *   Replanting areas where vegetation has died off.
    *   Weeding to remove invasive species.
    *   Fertilizing to promote healthy growth.
    *   Pruning and trimming.
*   **Repairing Structures:**
    *   Replacing displaced riprap or armour stone.
    *   Repairing cracks in retaining walls or seawalls.
    *   Replacing damaged geotextiles.
    *   Re-grading eroded areas.
    *   Addressing drainage problems.
*   **Sediment Removal:**
    *   Dredging or removing accumulated sediment from sediment traps or other areas.
*   **Erosion Control Structure Enhancement:**
    *   Adding additional riprap or armour stone to reinforce existing structures.
    *   Installing new erosion control measures to address unforeseen erosion problems.

**4. Reporting and Documentation:**

*   **Inspection Reports:** Detailed reports documenting the findings of visual inspections and performance monitoring.
*   **Maintenance Logs:** Records of all maintenance activities performed.
*   **Adaptive Management:** A key element is the use of monitoring data to adapt the maintenance strategy over time. If the erosion control measures are not performing as expected, adjustments may be needed.

**Where to Look for Project-Specific Information:**

*   **City of Toronto Website:** Search the City of Toronto's website for documents related to the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project. Look for environmental impact assessments, engineering reports, construction plans, and project updates.
*   **Public Consultations:** Check for records of public consultations or meetings related to the project. These may contain information about the long-term monitoring and maintenance plan.
*   **Project Contractors:** Contact the contractors or engineering firms involved in the project. They may be able to provide you with more detailed information.

Good luck finding the specific documentation you need! Remember to search using keywords like "Humber Bay Park East," "erosion control," "maintenance plan," "monitoring," and "shoreline stabilization."
