The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project addresses potential social impacts and ensures the safety of the local community through several measures:

*   **Public Safety:** The project considers potential risks to public safety, especially along trails and the slope itself, and evaluates the need for safety features like fences (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 42).
*   **Pedestrian Traffic:** During construction, pedestrian traffic will be temporarily restricted along the paved pathway behind Peacham Crescent (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 36).
*   **Public Consultation:** Public notifications and consultations were conducted, starting with a Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018. Notices were sent to community groups, homeowners near the project site, and Indigenous communities (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 48).
*   **Risk Mitigation:** The primary purpose of the project is to protect human life and property from erosion and slope instability hazards, particularly following the 2013 severe weather event that caused slumping behind properties on Peacham Crescent (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 4; 2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 11, 12).
*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Sediment control fencing will be installed before construction to prevent substances from entering the watercourse, and these barriers will be maintained throughout construction until the site is stabilized (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 15).
