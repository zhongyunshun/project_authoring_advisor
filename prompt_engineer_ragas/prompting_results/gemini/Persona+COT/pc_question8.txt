Based on the provided documents, the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" does not explicitly detail long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the slope stabilization measures. However, the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf" mentions periodic maintenance of vegetation during the first couple of years until it becomes well established (page 43). It also mentions maintenance costs associated with the proposed structure (page 42). For further details, it is recommended to consult Section 5 â€“ Remediation Design in the Detailed Design Brief (Terraprobe, 2020) (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 13).
