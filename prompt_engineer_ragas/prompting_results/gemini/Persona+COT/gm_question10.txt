The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project addresses biodiversity in several ways:

*   **Tree Removals and Injuries:** To facilitate construction, a significant number of trees are slated for removal (180 trees) and injury (38 trees). The project aims to minimize tree removals by utilizing existing open greenspace. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, p. 14; 2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 37)

*   **Species at Risk: Butternut Trees:** The project identifies butternut trees within the construction access route. A genetically pure butternut tree was identified. The project plans to protect or recover butternut in the area. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 27; 2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, p. 11)

*   **Habitat Impact Mitigation:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible and occur outside key migration and breeding windows. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 26) Tree removal will be minimal and selective. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 27)

*   **Restoration Plantings:** Post-construction, restoration activities will focus on replanting suitable native species to compensate for those removed and enhance overall biodiversity. Planting native species can improve native species representation. The planted vegetation will provide increased soil stabilization, reduce surficial erosion, and add to the biodiversity of the local ecosystem.

*   **Exotic Species:** The ecology survey identified 16 exotic plant species. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 27)

*   **Wildlife Populations:** There are no significant wildlife populations identified within the Project limits; therefore, there are no anticipated impacts resulting from the proposed works. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 28)

*   **Nesting Birds:** Tree removals will only occur outside the nesting window between October 4th and October 22nd to avoid nesting birds (as per the Migratory Birds Convention Act). (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 27; 2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, p. 16)
