The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project includes several measures to protect local wildlife and minimize disruption, particularly for aquatic species:

*   **Aquatic Habitat Considerations:** Discussions are underway between TRCA, DFO, City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design, including a surcharged revetment (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 30).
*   **Minimizing Disturbance:** Protection structures are designed to minimize cutting and disturbing native material, acknowledging the potential for contamination in the shoreline's native composition (Design Brief - Phase II\_DRAFT.pdf, page 22).
*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Prior to construction, staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated with standard silt socks to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 32; HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 33).
*   **Tree Protection:** Tree protection barriers will be erected where necessary, avoiding grade changes and storage of materials/equipment within the Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 33).
*   **Habitat Restoration:** Disturbed areas are to be restored to existing conditions or better, with vegetation implemented where needed (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 33).

The baseline inventory identified species such as Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt (Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 14), and the project aims to mitigate potential impacts on these and other aquatic species.
