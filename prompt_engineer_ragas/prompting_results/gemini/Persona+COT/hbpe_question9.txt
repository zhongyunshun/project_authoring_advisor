Here's information regarding Indigenous engagements and consultations during project planning and implementation, based on the provided TRCA documents:

*   **General Approach:** TRCA aims to develop positive relationships with Indigenous communities potentially impacted by its projects through meaningful and respectful engagement (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 575). Engagement is intended to provide Indigenous Communities with an opportunity to receive information about and have input to the project proposal and, equally allows TRCA to identify and consider the concerns and issues of those communities (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 49). The communication process respects the culture and practices of the Indigenous communities being engaged, incorporating open dialogue and regular feedback opportunities (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 46).

*   **Consultation Process:** Prior to notifications, the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) was contacted for advice on which Indigenous communities to contact. Additional Indigenous community contact lists were also considered (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 49). The Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation (MIRR) and the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MOECC) were also contacted for advice and information on Indigenous communities to contact during the Indigenous Engagement process (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 292).

*   **Communities Involved:** Several Indigenous communities are known to have an interest in the study area, including (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 47):

Assurance was given that they would be notified if additional archaeology was required (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 292).
    *   Environmental Studies: Certain First Nations (Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation (MNCFN), Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation (MSIFN), and Hiawatha First Nation) showed interest in completed and planned ecological and aquatic studies and were provided with a memo summarizing the environmental studies and digital access to completed studies (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 292).
    *   MNCFN Involvement: The Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation (MNCFN) requested information about planned archaeological assessments and environmental studies and indicated interest in participation by MNCFN Field Liaison Representatives (FLRs) (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 293).

*   **Documentation:** A full record of Indigenous community consultation, including copies of all correspondence, can be found in the Record of Indigenous Engagement for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project in Appendix D (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 50).
