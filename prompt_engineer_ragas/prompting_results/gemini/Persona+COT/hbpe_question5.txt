The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is being implemented in three phases due to the extent of the project area and the multi-year nature of construction (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 4). Final site restoration will occur following completion of all three phases of the project, with the exception of some preliminary restoration along the Eastern Headland (seeding and trail repairs) following completion of Phase I (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 35). Phase III will involve placing beach material to the east of a structure (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 27).
