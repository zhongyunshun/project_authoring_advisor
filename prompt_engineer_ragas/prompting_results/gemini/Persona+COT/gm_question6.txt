The erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park considers potential social impacts, including access to parklands and community recreational spaces. The erosion occurring along German Mills Creek within the park poses a potential public health risk and a risk to trail infrastructure, potentially impacting park users' safety and recreational activities (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 30). The project aims to preserve public enjoyment of the natural space while enhancing the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic habitat (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 371). Design alternatives are evaluated considering potential risks to trail and park users, including the need for safety features like fences (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 40).
