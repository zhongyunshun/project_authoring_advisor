The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, as documented in the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf," addresses potential environmental and social impacts through several measures:

**Environmental Impacts and Mitigation:**

*   **Wildlife Habitat:** The document acknowledges the potential for impacts on existing natural habitat within the project limits. To minimize these impacts, construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible and occur outside key migration and breeding windows. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26)
*   **Wetlands:** Two wetland vegetation communities were observed along the southern limits of the Project area (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 28)
*   **Unique Landforms:** The document states that there are no known unique landforms within or adjacent to the project limits, so no impacts are anticipated. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 23, 45)
*   **Erosion in Ecosystem:** The potential for erosion and slope instability within a local ecosystem is greatly influenced by the type of land use of the surrounding areas (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 38)
*   **Vegetation:** The project aims for less impact on existing vegetation and excess soil removal (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 44)

**Social Impacts and Mitigation:**

*   **Public Safety:** The project considers potential risks to public safety, especially along trails and the slope, and includes the requirement for safety features like safety fences. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 42)
*   **Recreational Use:** The parkland corridor adjacent to Peacham Crescent is actively used for recreation. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 29)
*   **Property Accessibility:** Two possible access route options have been proposed to gain access to the slope behind 21, 23, and 25 (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 37)
*   **Public Consultation:** Public notification and consultation occurred with the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018. Notices were sent to community groups, homeowners in the vicinity of the Project site, Indigenous communities (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 48)

The project also considers potential impacts on surrounding neighborhoods, communities, surrounding land uses, and existing infrastructure (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 47).
