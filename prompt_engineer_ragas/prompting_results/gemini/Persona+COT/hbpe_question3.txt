The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates sustainable development practices to ensure long-term environmental conservation. These practices include:

*   **Minimizing Excavation:** Designs place new material over existing structures where toe and slope stability permits, thereby minimizing excavation requirements. (Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 15)
*   **Protection of Native Material:** Protection structures are designed to minimize cutting and disturbing of native material, considering potential contamination of the shoreline material. (Design Brief - Phase II\_DRAFT.pdf, page 22)
*   **Site Restoration and Monitoring:** Site restoration includes regrading and seeding in Phase I, with a full Restoration Plan as part of the detailed designs for the final phase. Post-construction monitoring involves inspections after major storm events and annually to ensure the works are stable and performing as designed.
