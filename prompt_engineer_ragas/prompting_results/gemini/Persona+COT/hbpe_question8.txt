The TRCA documents specify the following regarding long-term monitoring and maintenance of erosion control measures, particularly within the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Projects:

*   **Post-Construction Monitoring:** Sites are inspected after major storm events during the first year and annually thereafter to ensure stability and performance as designed. Any required maintenance will be addressed (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 36; HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 37).
*   **Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Measures:** ESC measures are implemented before and maintained during construction to prevent sediment entry into the water. Damaged ESC measures should be repaired or replaced within 48 hours of inspection (Detailed Design - Phase I.pdf, page 4). The strategies are not static and may need upgrading/amendment if site conditions change (Detailed Design - Phase I.pdf, page 4).
*   **Pre- and Post-Construction Erosion Monitoring:** Monitoring should include a record of photographs. Monitoring of proposed vegetation should also be conducted for two (2) years after planting to ensure survivability (2015-05-19 Cole AREA E - Peacham Cres.pdf, page 5).
*   **Site Restoration and Monitoring:** For Phase I of the Humber Bay Park East project, site restoration is limited to regrading and seeding. The full Restoration Plan will be part of the detailed designs for the final phase of the project, with plantings occurring after implementation (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 34). Final site restoration will occur following completion of all three phases of the project, with the exception of some preliminary restoration along the Eastern Headland (seeding and trail repairs) following completion of (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 35).
*   **Maintenance of Erosion and Sediment Control Measures:** Effective erosion and sediment control measures will be maintained until the site is re-vegetated (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 34). During construction, regular monitoring by trained professionals will be conducted to ensure that all best management practices are being used to avoid or minimize disturbance to the environment (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 45).
