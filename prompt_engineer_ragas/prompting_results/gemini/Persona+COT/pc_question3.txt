The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" outlines several strategies that promote sustainable development and conservation throughout the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project:

*   **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures:** Prior to construction, the work area will be isolated using standard sediment control fencing to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse. These barriers will be inspected and maintained throughout construction and will remain until the site is stabilized (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 15).
*   **Smallest Construction Footprint:** In an effort to minimize impacts, all construction activities are planned to have the smallest construction footprint as possible. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26)
*   **Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26)
