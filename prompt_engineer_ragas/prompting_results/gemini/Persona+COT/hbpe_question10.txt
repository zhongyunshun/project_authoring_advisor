#### The provided documents describe restoration plantings in several projects, including preliminary plans for Phase I of a project (likely Humber Bay Park East, based on other document titles), but they don't explicitly detail how these plantings *specifically* contribute to mitigating biodiversity loss concerning species at risk. However, some documents provide general context:

*   **General Habitat Enhancement:** Several documents mention the use of native species in restoration plantings to enhance biodiversity and create a more robust local environment. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27; HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 35; 2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 44). The Peacham Crescent project aims to improve soil stabilization, reduce erosion, and increase biodiversity through native vegetation (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 40).

*   **Removal of Exotic Species:** Some projects involve the removal of exotic species and replacement with native plantings (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27; German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 188). This can improve native species representation (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 226).

*   **Compensation for Tree Removal:** Restoration plantings are often used to compensate for tree removals required for construction (2021-02-24 Project Brief\_90 percent.pdf, page 9; 2021-02-24 Project Brief\_90 percent.pdf, page 11).

*   **Riparian Habitat Restoration:** One document details riparian planting goals, including restoring ecosystem form and function, enhancing natural cover and critical habitat, increasing stream bank stability, and reducing erosion/sedimentation (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 768).

**In summary:** While the documents confirm that restoration plantings are a key component of TRCA projects and aim to improve habitat and biodiversity, they don't explicitly link Phase I planting plans to specific species at risk. To get that level of detail, you would need to consult the specific planting plans for HBPE Phase I.
