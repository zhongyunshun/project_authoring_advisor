Okay, I will answer your question about the methodology used for the "Slope Stability Analysis" in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, and its impact on project decisions, based on the provided TRCA documents.

Based on the documents provided, here's what I can tell you about the slope stability analysis methodology and its impact:

*   **Causes and Extent of Erosion:** The documents mention that the project was initiated to address erosion and slope instability hazards impacting the project site. TRCA conducted studies and assessments to evaluate the site and develop a remedial solution (Document 2).
*   **Severe Weather Event:** A severe weather event on July 8, 2013, caused significant slumping, slippage, and slope instability behind three properties on Peacham Crescent (Document 5).
*   **Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC):** The location of the projected long-term stable slope crest (LTSSC) in relation to permanent and essential structures at the top of the slope was a key consideration in the project (Document 4). Figure 7 illustrates the LTSSC projected behind Peacham Crescent with a factor of safety of 1.5 (Document 10). The source for this figure is Cole Engineering Group Ltd., 2015.
*   **Reference to Slope Stability Assessment:** Cole Engineering (2015) conducted a "SLOPE STABILITY & EROSION RISK ASSESSMENT" (Document 1, Document 16).
*   **Detailed Design Brief:** For further details on the scope of work and design rationale, the documents refer to Section 5 â€“ Remediation Design in the Detailed Design Brief (Terraprobe, 2020) (Document 12).
*   **Project Objectives:** The selected alternative for the project meets all three project objectives, including risk mitigation (Document 9).

**Impact on Project Decisions:**

*   The slope stability analysis directly influenced the selection of a remedial solution to protect human life and property from valley slope erosion (Document 7).
*   The location of the LTSSC influenced decisions related to permanent and essential structures (Document 4).
*   The analysis helped in addressing drainage and stormwater runoff concerns (Document 9).

In summary, the slope stability analysis, conducted by Cole Engineering, was a crucial part of understanding the hazards at the Peacham Crescent site and informed the selection of the preferred solution. The LTSSC was a key factor considered in the design. For detailed specifics on the methodology, the documents direct the reader to the Terraprobe Design Brief.
