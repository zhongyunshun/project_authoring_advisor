The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses biodiversity impacts, particularly concerning bat species and butternut trees, as follows:

*   **Butternut Trees:** A Category 2 butternut tree was identified within the project area, located along the proposed access route. A Category 2 tree is defined as one not affected by Butternut Canker or affected but not to an advanced degree (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 11). The Class EA Project Plan notes that butternuts are classified as an endangered species in North America and protected under Ontario’s Endangered Species Act. Genetic testing revealed the butternut within the construction access route is genetically pure and highly susceptible to butternut canker (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27).

*   **Bat Species:** Bat habitat is present within the project area, and appropriate compensation will be coordinated by TRCA’s ERM Project staff in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 10).

The project also includes measures to minimize impacts on existing natural habitat by planning construction activities with the smallest footprint possible and outside key migration and breeding windows. Post-construction restoration activities will focus on replanting suitable native species to compensate for removals and enhance overall biodiversity (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26-27).
