The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project: Phase II â€“ Western Headland project impacts local wildlife. The effect of the proposed structure on aquatic habitat was evaluated in plan view to calculate the areas of fish habitat that would be altered or lost as a result of the construction (Design Brief - Phase II_DRAFT.pdf, page 25). Discussions are underway between TRCA, DFO, City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 30). Phase II includes preliminary planting plan, 152 on-site compensation plantings of at least 50 mm caliper are proposed to mitigate the project impacts (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 36).
