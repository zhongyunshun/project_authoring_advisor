The Slope Stability and Erosion Risk Assessment (SS&ERA) defines the Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC) as the modeled natural regression of a slope crest resulting from erosion forces, based on the composition and conditions of substrate materials (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 16).

In the context of the Peacham Crescent projects, the following criteria were used to determine the LTSSC:

*   **Factor of Safety (FoS):** A factor of safety of 1.5 was used in a 2015 SS&ERA to delineate the LTSSC behind Peacham Crescent (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 16). However, a factor of safety of 1.3 is also mentioned in relation to the LTSSC (2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final.pdf, page 16).
*   **Subsurface Investigation:** Cole Engineering Group Ltd. conducted a subsurface investigation to delineate the LTSSC (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 16). Soil Engineers Ltd. also conducted borehole drilling to evaluate the LTSSC (2015-05-19 Cole AREA E - Peacham Cres.pdf, page 13).
*   **Field Investigations:** Field investigations were used to propose preliminary alternatives based on feasibility and the ability to mitigate risk to infrastructure, private property, and human life (2015-05-19 Cole AREA E - Peacham Cres.pdf, page 13).
*   **Consideration of Structures:** The location of the projected LTSSC in relation to permanent and essential structures at the top of the slope was considered (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 16).
*   **Presence of a Public Footpath:** The presence of a public footpath at the base of the slope was also taken into account (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 16).
*   **Potentially Impacted Infrastructure:** The presence of potentially impacted infrastructure located within the tributary and surrounding area was considered (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 16).
*   **Geotechnical Investigation:** Geotechnical investigations were completed to determine the position of the LTSSC along a section of valley slope behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 20).
