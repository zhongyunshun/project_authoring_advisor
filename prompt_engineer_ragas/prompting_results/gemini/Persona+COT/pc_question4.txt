The roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the Class Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project are not explicitly detailed in the provided documents. However, the documents do mention the following relevant information:

*   **Conservation Authorities:** Conservation Authorities, under the Conservation Authorities Act, have a mandate related to reducing risk to life and property (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 3).
*   **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA):** TRCA is the primary organization undertaking the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf). They are responsible for conducting studies and assessments to evaluate the project site and develop remedial solutions (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 18). TRCA also prepared the Class EA Project Plan (multiple documents). Alistair Jolly and Alvina Tam from TRCA are acknowledged for their contributions to the project (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 2).
*   **Public:** Public notification and consultation occurred, including sending notices to community groups, homeowners near the project, and Indigenous communities (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 48).
*   **Minister of the Environment:** In certain situations, a request may be referred to the Minister of the Environment for a decision (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 49).

The documents suggest a process where TRCA takes the lead, consults with the public, and adheres to the Class EA process. Further details on specific roles and responsibilities might be found in the full Class EA documentation or related agreements.
