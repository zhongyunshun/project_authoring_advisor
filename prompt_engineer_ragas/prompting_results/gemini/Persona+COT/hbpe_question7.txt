The selection of erosion control structures in the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief" considers both their effectiveness and environmental impact. Key points include:

*   **Existing Erosion Control Structures:** The project area includes three erosion control structures, whose condition is summarized in Table 1 of the document. Photos and sketches of the structures are presented in Figure 3 through Figure 12. (Document 1, page 5)
*   **Eastern Armourstone Headland (WF11.12):** The condition of the eastern armourstone headland (WF11.12) shows visible displacement of material, backshore erosion, and scouring. (Document 2, page 11)
*   **Cobble/Rubble Beach (WF11.11):** The concept designs for the beach call for placement of fill over the existing profile of the beach. (Document 17, page 19)
*   **Pond Outlet Area:** Repair of the pond outlet area by creating an armourstone berm that allows for drainage of the ponds. (Document 12, page 25)

The proposed concepts have been designed to address the leading erosion concerns of the park, including low crest elevation and wave overtopping, by placing new material over the existing structures where toe and slope stability permits, thereby minimizing excavation requirements. (Document 5, page 15)

Smaller cobble sizes will offer a more user-friendly beach environment for park users than larger stone, but more material will be required to sufficiently protect the shoreline. Treatments using smaller cobble will therefore have higher costs and a greater in-water footprint as well as greater potential for maintenance needs. (Document 11, page 20)
