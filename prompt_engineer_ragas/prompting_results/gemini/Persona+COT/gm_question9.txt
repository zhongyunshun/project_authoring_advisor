TRCA engages with Indigenous communities in several ways during project development, including:

*   **Meaningful and Mutually Respectful Engagement:** TRCA aims to develop positive relationships with Aboriginal communities whose interests may be impacted by TRCA projects, through a process of meaningful and mutually respectful engagement (Document 1).
*   **Varying Forms of Engagement:** Engagement may take on different forms depending on the scope of the project and the interests of the community (Document 3). This acknowledges the range of views and experiences Indigenous communities can contribute.
*   **Opportunity for Input:** Indigenous engagement provides communities with the opportunity to receive information about and have input into project proposals (Document 3).
*   **Identifying Interests:** Engagement allows TRCA to identify and address community interests (Document 3).
*   **Consultation with Specific Communities:** TRCA consults with various First Nations and Indigenous organizations (Documents 7, 9). For example, the Peacham Crescent project involved notifications to Indigenous communities (Document 19).
*   **Record of Consultation:** A full record of Indigenous community consultation, including correspondence, is maintained for projects like the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project (Document 13).
*   **Addressing Concerns:** TRCA addresses concerns raised by Indigenous communities during consultations (Document 13). For example, in the German Mills project, discussions with MNCFN led to an agreement for a later meeting (Document 14).
*   **Archaeological Assessments:** TRCA recognizes the importance of consulting with Aboriginal communities on planning matters that may affect their rights and interests, especially concerning ancestral archaeological sites (Document 11). In the Peacham Crescent project, archaeological assessments were provided to the Huron-Wendat Nation and Six Nations of the Grand River Territory (Document 22).
