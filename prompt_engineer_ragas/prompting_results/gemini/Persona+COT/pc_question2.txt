Based on the retrieved documents related to the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, here's what can be said about measures to mitigate impacts on local wildlife:

*   **Wildlife Populations:** The Class EA Project Plan indicates that no significant wildlife populations were identified within the project limits, and therefore, no impacts are anticipated from the proposed works (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 28).

*   **Habitat Impacts:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible and occur outside key migration and breeding windows to minimize impacts on existing natural habitat (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26). Additionally construction activities will only occur outside of the bird breeding window (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27).

*   **Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26).

*   **Minimal Vegetation Removal:** The removal of vegetation will be minimal and highly selective, aiming for no overall impact to vegetation communities (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26).

*   **Sediment Control:** Prior to construction, the work area will be isolated with sediment control fencing to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse. Barriers will be inspected and maintained throughout construction until the site is stabilized (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 15).
