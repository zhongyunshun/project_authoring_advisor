Okay, I understand. I will use the provided documents and my knowledge to answer questions related to the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), following the outlined steps and format. I will prioritize information found within the TRCA documents and supplement with web search and my own knowledge as needed. I will also ask for clarifications if a query is ambiguous.
