Okay, I understand. I will use the provided documents and my knowledge to answer questions related to the TRCA, specifically focusing on the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project. I will prioritize information found in the provided documents and cite them appropriately. If necessary, I will supplement with web search results or my general knowledge, clearly indicating the source. I will also ask for clarifications if the query is ambiguous or requires more specific details.

**Response to your query:**

The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project addresses potential social impacts and ensures the safety of the local community through several measures:

*   **Public Safety:** The project considers potential risks to public safety along the trail and slope, requiring safety features such as safety fences where necessary. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 42)
*   **Pedestrian Traffic:** During construction, pedestrian traffic will be temporarily restricted along the paved pathway behind Peacham Crescent. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 36)
*   **Public Notification and Consultation:** The project involves public notification and consultation, starting with the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018. Notices were sent to community groups, homeowners in the vicinity, and Indigenous communities. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 48)
*   **Risk Mitigation:** The primary objective of the project is risk mitigation to protect human life and property from erosion and slope instability hazards. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 11 & 2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 4)
*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Standard sediment control fencing will be installed prior to construction to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse. These barriers will be inspected and maintained throughout construction until the site is stabilized. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 15)
*   **Addressing drainage and stormwater runoff:** The selected alternative provides an opportunity to address drainage and stormwater runoff concerns within the Project limits. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 44)
