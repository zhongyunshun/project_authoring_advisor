#### Are there future phases or expansions planned for the erosion control and slope stabilization efforts discussed in the Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent projects? ####
Yes, both the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project and the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project involve phased approaches.

**Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project:**

*   The project is divided into three phases for design and implementation due to the extent of the project area and the multi-year nature of construction (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 4; HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 4).

**Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project:**

*   The document provided is a Class EA Project Plan, which suggests a planning and assessment phase for erosion control and slope stabilization. While the document details the project plan, it does not explicitly mention future phases or expansions beyond the scope of the plan itself (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf).
