#### Can you elaborate on the roles and responsibilities of TRCA and the City of Toronto in the maintenance and administration of Humber Bay Park East as described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" ####

To accurately detail the roles and responsibilities of TRCA and the City of Toronto in the maintenance and administration of Humber Bay Park East, it would be helpful to consult the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" document directly. If you can provide specific sections or context from that document, I can give you a more precise answer. Based on the documents, discussions are underway between TRCA, DFO, City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 30).
