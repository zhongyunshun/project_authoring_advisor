Response: "According to the '2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf' document (page 20), three conceptual alternative solutions, in addition to the ‘Do Nothing’ alternative, were considered to address the erosion and slope instability behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent. The document also mentions that a full account of the physical condition studies of the project area can be found in Appendix A, which contains the complete geotechnical report(s). Additionally, the '2015-05-19 Cole AREA E - Peacham Cres.pdf' document (pages 10, 61, and 111) states that Soil Engineers Ltd. provided five potential alternatives, including the 'Do Nothing' approach, assessed based on feasibility, constructability, and cost."
