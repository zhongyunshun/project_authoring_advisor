The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity, particularly concerning bat species and butternut trees, as follows:

*   **Butternut Trees:** A Category 2 butternut tree has been identified within the project area, generally located along the proposed access route. A Category 2 tree is defined as one that is not affected by Butternut Canker or is affected but not to an advanced degree (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 11). Further genetic testing revealed that the butternut is genetically pure and therefore highly susceptible to butternut canker (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27).
*   **Bat Species:** Bat habitat is present within the project, and appropriate compensation will be coordinated by TRCA’s ERM Project staff in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 10).

Additionally, the document mentions that a terrestrial biological survey was undertaken by TRCA’s Environmental Monitoring and Data Management (EMDM) in 2018 to inventory existing flora and fauna within and surrounding the Project area (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 10). The proposed works are designed to have minimal impact on vegetation communities, with tree or shrub removals planned to be highly selective (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27). Post-construction restoration activities will focus on replanting suitable native species to compensate for those that were removed and enhance the overall biodiversity of the Project area (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27).
