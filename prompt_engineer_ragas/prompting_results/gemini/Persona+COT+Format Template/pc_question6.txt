Here's an analysis of the anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, as documented in the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP," and the proposed mitigation measures:

**Environmental Impacts and Mitigation:**

*   **Wildlife Habitat:** The project area does not have significant wildlife populations. Construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible and occur outside key migration and breeding windows to minimize impacts on existing natural habitat (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26).
*   **Wetlands:** Two wetland vegetation communities were observed along the southern limits of the Project area (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 28).
*   **Unique Landforms:** There are no known unique landforms within or adjacent to the Project limits; therefore, there will be no impacts resulting from the proposed works (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 23).
*   **Erosion and Slope Instability:** The potential for erosion and slope instability within a local ecosystem is greatly influenced by the type of land use of the surrounding areas (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 38).
*   **Vegetation:** The selected alternative has less impact on existing vegetation and excess soil removal than Alternative 2 and provides an opportunity to address drainage and stormwater runoff concerns within the Project limits (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 44).

**Social Impacts and Mitigation:**

*   **Public Safety:** The project aims to reduce risk to life and property, as per the mandate of Conservation Authorities under the Conservation Authorities Act (R.S.O 1990) (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 3). Potential risks to public safety are rated as low, but the project considers the requirement for safety features like safety fences (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 42).
*   **Property Accessibility:** Two possible access route options have been proposed to gain access to the slope behind 21, 23, and 25 (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 37).
*   **Recreational Use:** The adjacent parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent is actively used for recreational purposes (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 29).
*   **Public Consultation:** Public Notifications and Consultation occurred with the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018. Notices were sent to community groups, homeowners in the vicinity of the Project site, Indigenous communities (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 48).

**Overall Objectives:**

*   The primary objective of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project is to protect human life and property from the hazards of valley slope erosion by providing long-term, low-maintenance protection for the three private properties within the Project limits (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 7).
