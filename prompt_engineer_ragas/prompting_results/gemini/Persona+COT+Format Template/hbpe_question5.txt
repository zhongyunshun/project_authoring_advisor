#### What are the phases involved in the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project? ####
Based on the provided documents, the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is divided into three phases for design and implementation (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 4).

The documents specifically mention:

*   **Phase I:** Includes work on the Eastern Headland, such as site setup, construction of a temporary culvert and access bridge near the pond outlet, and limited site restoration involving regrading and seeding (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, pages 26, 34). A final version of the Detailed Design Report for Phase 1 was completed by October 2021 (Design Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 2 and Design Brief - Phase II_DRAFT.pdf, page 2).
*   **Phase II:** Focuses on the Western Headland (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 1). TRCA staff will continue to follow mitigation measures implemented during Phase I, maintaining the same access route into the site (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 24).
*   **Phase III:** Involves placing beach material to the east of a structure installed during Phase II (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 27).

Final site restoration, including plantings, is planned to occur following the completion of all three phases, with some preliminary restoration (seeding and trail repairs) after Phase I on the Eastern Headland (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 35 and HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 34).
