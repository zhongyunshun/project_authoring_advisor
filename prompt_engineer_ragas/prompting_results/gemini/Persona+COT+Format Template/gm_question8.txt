Query: #### What are the key objectives of the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project? ####
Answer: The key objectives of the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project include:

*   Addressing erosion concerns, such as low crest elevation and wave overtopping, by placing new material over existing structures where toe and slope stability permits, thereby minimizing excavation requirements (Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 15).
*   Returning erosion control structures to a state of good repair and providing long-term protection to the Humber Bay Park East shoreline (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 4).

The project is divided into three phases for design and implementation due to its extent and multi-year nature (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 4; HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 4).
