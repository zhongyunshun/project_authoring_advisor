**General Practices and Intentions:**

*   TRCA aims to develop positive relationships with Aboriginal communities whose interests may be impacted by TRCA projects through meaningful and mutually respectful engagement (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 575).
*   Indigenous Engagement is intended to provide Indigenous Communities with an opportunity to receive information about and have input to the project proposal (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 49).
*   The communication process respects the culture and practices of the Indigenous communities being engaged, incorporating open dialogue and regular feedback opportunities (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 46).

**Specific Actions and Projects:**

*   Prior to notifications, the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 49) and the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation (MIRR) and the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MOECC) (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 292) were contacted for advice on which Indigenous communities to contact during the engagement process.
*   The Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation (MNCFN), Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation (MSIFN), and Hiawatha First Nation indicated interest in completed and planned ecological and aquatic studies and were provided with a memo summarizing these studies (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 292).
*   In the German Mills Setters Park Sanitary Protection Project, TRCA's Indigenous Engagement guidelines (2015) were followed. MNCFN requested Field Liaison Representatives (FLRs) participation for archeological assessments (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 293).
*   A record of Indigenous community consultation, including copies of all correspondence, can be found in Appendix D of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project documentation (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 50).
*   Archaeological Assessments: Nations were informed about completed Stage 1-2 Archaeological Assessments, and copies were provided to those who expressed interest. All nations were assured they would be notified if additional archaeology was required (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 292).

**Communities Involved:**

*   The documents mention engagement with Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation, Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 50), Williams Treaties First Nations, and the Huron-Wendat Nation (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 28).

It is important to note that engagement methods may vary depending on the project scope and the interests of each community (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 49)."
