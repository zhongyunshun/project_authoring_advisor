The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project addresses biodiversity in several ways, with specific attention to species at risk:

**Tree Removals and Impacts:**

*   **Number of Trees:** To facilitate construction, 180 trees are slated for removal, with an additional 38 expected to be injured. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 14)
*   **Selective Removal:** Tree removal is planned to be minimal and highly selective to minimize impacts on vegetation communities. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27)

**Mitigation and Restoration:**

*   **Restoration Plantings:** Post-construction, restoration activities will focus on replanting suitable native species to compensate for removals and enhance overall biodiversity. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27)
*   **Ecological Gains:** Although Buckthorn are recognized, the restoration plantings of native species are expected to improve native species representation. (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 226)
*   **Soil Stabilization:** The planted vegetation will increase soil stabilization, reduce surficial erosion, and enhance the biodiversity of the local ecosystem. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 40)

**Species at Risk:**

*   **Butternut Trees:** A Category 2 butternut tree (not severely affected by Butternut Canker) was identified within the project area, located along the proposed access route. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 11) Genetic testing was conducted to determine the purity and susceptibility of butternuts to butternut canker. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27)
*   **Protection Measures:** Efforts to retain butternut trees could support the protection or recovery of the species in the area. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 11)

**General Biodiversity Considerations:**

*   **Habitat Impact:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible and occur outside key migration and breeding windows. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26)
*   **Exotic Species:** The ecology survey identified 16 exotic plant species, with disturbance levels ranging from moderate to severe. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27)
*   **No Significant Wildlife Populations:** No significant wildlife populations were identified within the project limits, so no impacts are anticipated from the proposed works. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 28)
*   **Minimal Impact to Bird Habitat:** The project is expected to have minimal impacts on bird habitat, and construction will occur outside the bird breeding window. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27)
