#### What long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies are outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects such as the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" ####
The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" outlines the following long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for erosion control measures:

*   **Post-Construction Monitoring:** The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter to ensure that the implemented works are stable and performing as designed. Any maintenance required will be performed (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 36).
*   **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures:** Erosion and sediment control (ESC) measures will be implemented prior to, and maintained during the construction phases, to prevent entry of sediment into the water. All damaged erosion and sediment control measures should be repaired and/or replaced within 48 hours of the inspection (Detailed Design - Phase I.pdf, page 4). The erosion and sediment control strategies outlined on the plans are not static and may need to be upgraded/amended as site conditions change to minimize sediment laden runoff from leaving the work areas (Detailed Design - Phase I.pdf, page 4).
*   **Site Restoration and Monitoring:** For Phase I of the project, site restoration will be limited to regrading and seeding. The full Restoration Plan will be part of the detailed designs for the final phase of the project and plantings will occur after the implementation (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 34).
*   **Pre and Post-Construction Erosion Monitoring:** Pre‐construction and post‐construction erosion monitoring of the proposed works should be implemented including a record of photographs. Monitoring of proposed vegetation should also be conducted for two (2) years after planting to ensure survivability (2015-05-19 Cole AREA E - Peacham Cres.pdf, page 5).
*   **Prioritize Long-Term Resiliency:** The overall approach to the designs was to prioritize long-term resiliency while reducing the need for excavation and off -site disposal to limit disturbance and impacts of the construction activities as well as addressing the leading erosion concerns of the park, including low crest elevation and wave overtopping (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 26).
