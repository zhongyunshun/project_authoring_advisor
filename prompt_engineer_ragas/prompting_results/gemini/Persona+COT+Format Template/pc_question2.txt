Okay, I understand. I'm ready to answer questions based on the provided TRCA documents, supplemented by web search and my own knowledge. I will prioritize TRCA documents and cite my sources. Let's begin.

#### In light of the findings from the Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, what specific measures are proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, especially concerning species identified in the vicinity? ####
Based on the provided documents related to the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, here's what can be said about measures to mitigate impacts on local wildlife:

*   **Minimal Construction Footprint and Timing:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible and will occur outside key migration and breeding windows to minimize impacts on existing natural habitat (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26).
*   **Limited Impact on Bird Habitat:** The project is expected to result in minimal impacts to bird habitat through the selective removal of canopy trees. Construction will occur outside of the bird breeding window to avoid impacting breeding bird activities (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27).
*   **Sediment and Erosion Control:** Standard sediment control fencing will be used to isolate the work area and prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 15).

It's important to note that the documents indicate that no significant wildlife populations were identified within the project limits, leading to the conclusion that there are no anticipated impacts resulting from the proposed works (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 28). However, a terrestrial biological survey was conducted to inventory existing flora and fauna (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 21 and 2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 10).

To provide a more comprehensive answer, could you clarify which specific species identified in the vicinity you are most concerned about? Knowing the specific species will allow for a more targeted search within the documents and potentially online to determine if any species-specific mitigation measures are planned or recommended.
