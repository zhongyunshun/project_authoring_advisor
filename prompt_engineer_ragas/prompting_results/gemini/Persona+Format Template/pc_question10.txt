The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity, particularly in relation to bat species and butternut trees, as follows:

*   **Butternut:** A Category 2 butternut tree has been identified within the project area, generally located along the proposed access route. A Category 2 tree is one that is not affected by Butternut Canker or is affected but not to an advanced degree (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, 11). Genetic testing determined that the butternut within the construction access route is genetically pure and therefore highly susceptible to butternut canker (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, 27).
*   **Bat Species:** Bat habitat is present within the project, and appropriate compensation will be coordinated by TRCAâ€™s ERM Project staff in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, 10).
*   **General Measures:** The project aims to minimize impacts on existing natural habitat by planning construction activities with the smallest footprint possible and outside of key migration and breeding windows (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, 26). Tree or shrub removals will be planned and highly selective (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, 27). Post-construction restoration activities will focus on replanting suitable native species to compensate for those that were removed and enhance the overall biodiversity of the Project (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, 27).
