The Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project documents indicate several measures to mitigate impacts on local wildlife:

*   **Minimizing Construction Footprint:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible to minimize impacts on existing natural habitat (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26).

*   **Timing of Construction:** Construction will occur outside of key migration and breeding windows when habitat use is not as crucial (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26).

*   **Bird Habitat:** The project will result in minimal impacts to bird habitat through the selective removal of canopy trees, and construction activities will occur outside of the bird breeding window (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27).

*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Standard sediment control fencing will be used to isolate the work area and prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 15).

*   **Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26).
