Okay, I understand. I will use the provided documents and my knowledge to answer questions about TRCA's technical documents, focusing on accuracy and citing sources. I will also ask for clarification when needed.

#### How does the erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park plan to address potential social impacts, such as access to parklands and community recreational spaces? ####
Based on the provided documents, the erosion hazard management in German Mills Settlers Park considers potential risks to trail and park users, impacting public safety and potentially requiring safety features like fences (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 40). The project also aims to preserve public enjoyment of the natural space while enhancing the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic habitat (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 371).

To provide a more comprehensive answer, could you clarify which specific aspect of social impacts you are most interested in (e.g., impact on recreational activities, access to specific areas, or community engagement)?
