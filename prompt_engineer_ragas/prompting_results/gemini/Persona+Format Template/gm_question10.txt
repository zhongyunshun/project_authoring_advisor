The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project involves both tree removals and restoration plantings. Here's how these activities relate to biodiversity, particularly concerning species at risk:

**Tree Removals:**

*   **Extent of Removals:** To facilitate construction access and stabilization works, approximately 180 trees are slated for removal, with an additional 38 trees expected to be injured. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 14)
*   **Species at Risk - Butternut:** A Category 2 butternut tree (one that is not significantly affected by Butternut Canker) has been identified within the project area, along the proposed access route. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 11) Genetic testing confirmed that a butternut within the construction access route is genetically pure and therefore highly susceptible to butternut canker. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27) TRCA has obtained appropriate permits and approvals required to plan and complete any works within the project site, including City of Toronto - Tree Protection Plan Review permit. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 11)
*   **Timing:** Tree removals are scheduled to occur outside the nesting window for birds, specifically between October 4th and October 22nd, to comply with the Migratory Birds Convention Act. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 16)

**Restoration Plantings:**

*   **Focus on Native Species:** Post-construction restoration activities will prioritize replanting suitable native species to compensate for removed trees and enhance the overall biodiversity of the project area. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27)
*   **Ecological Gains:** While buckthorn are recognized, the project aims for an ecological gain by improving native species representation through restoration plantings. (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 226)
*   **Benefits of Planted Vegetation:** The planted vegetation will increase soil stabilization, reduce surficial erosion, and contribute to the biodiversity of the local ecosystem. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 40)

**Mitigation Measures:**

*   **Minimizing Impacts:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible and occur outside key migration and breeding windows. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26)
*   **Selective Removals:** Tree or shrub removals will be planned and highly selective. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27)
*   **Habitat Impact:** The project will result in only minimal impacts to bird habitat through the removal of select canopy trees. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27)

Could you please clarify if you're interested in a specific aspect of the biodiversity impact (e.g., a particular species, a specific type of habitat, or the overall ecological function of the area)?
