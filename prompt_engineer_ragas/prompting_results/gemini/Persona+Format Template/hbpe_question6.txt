The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project addresses potential social impacts and ensures the safety of the local community through several measures:

1.  **Public Safety:** The project considers potential risks to public safety along the trail and slope, and evaluates the requirement for safety features such as safety fences. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 42)
2.  **Pedestrian Traffic:** During construction, pedestrian traffic will be temporarily restricted along the paved pathway behind Peacham Crescent. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 36)
3.  **Public Consultation:** Public notifications were issued, and community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities were consulted. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 48)
4.  **Risk Mitigation:** The primary objective of the project is risk mitigation to protect human life and property from hazards of erosion and slope instability. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 11, 2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 4)
5.  **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Sediment control fencing will be installed to prevent substances from entering the watercourse. Barriers will be maintained throughout construction until the site is stabilized. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 15)
