Query: #### In the development and implementation of TRCA projects like those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay, how are local Indigenous communities consulted or involved? ####
Response: "TRCA engages with Indigenous communities in several ways during project development and implementation, aiming for meaningful and mutually respectful engagement. Here’s a breakdown of how this occurs, based on the provided documents:

1.  **Identifying and Engaging Communities:** TRCA recognizes the importance of consulting with Aboriginal communities whose rights and interests may be affected by TRCA projects (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 575 & 576). This involves identifying relevant Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, Huron-Wendat, and Métis nations, as TRCA's jurisdiction contains many overlapping traditional territories and treaty areas (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 576). For example, in the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, notices were sent to Indigenous communities as part of the public notification process (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 48).

2.  **Methods of Consultation:** Engagement may take different forms depending on the project scope and community interests (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 49). Consultation methods can include:

    *   Providing information about the project proposal and offering opportunities for input (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 49).
    *   Establishing informal partnerships or formal engagement for projects subject to legislation requiring engagement (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 575).
    *   Correspondence through courier and email (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 50).
    *   Community Liaison Committees (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 50).

3.  **Specific Examples of Engagement:**

    *   For the Peacham Crescent project, a record of Indigenous community consultation, including copies of all correspondence, can be found in the Record of Indigenous Engagement (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 50).
    *   TRCA consulted with several Indigenous communities and agencies, including Beausoleil First Nation, Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, and others (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 292). Table 4 in one document summarizes the Indigenous group consultation for a project (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 5 & 50).

4.  **Addressing Concerns:** TRCA provides opportunities for Indigenous communities to voice concerns about projects (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 49). For instance, the Huron-Wendat Nation and Six Nations of the Grand River Territory requested archaeological assessments for a project, and no further concerns were raised after the assessments were provided (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 50).

5.  **Overall Aims:** TRCA aims to develop positive relationships with Aboriginal communities whose interests may be impacted by TRCA projects, through a process of meaningful, mutually respectful engagement (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 575).

It's important to note that TRCA recognizes the need to balance waterfront revitalization/redevelopment, public access, and an open space aesthetic with natural heritage and natural hazard protection and management (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 591)."
