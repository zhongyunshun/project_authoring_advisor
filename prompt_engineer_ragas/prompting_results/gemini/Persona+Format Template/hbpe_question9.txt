#### Are there any specific engagements or consultations with local Indigenous communities detailed in the projects' planning and implementation phases ? ####
Yes, TRCA projects include specific engagements and consultations with local Indigenous communities during the planning and implementation phases. Here's a summary of how these engagements are conducted, according to the provided documents:

*   **Engagement Process**: Indigenous Engagement is designed to provide Indigenous Communities with an opportunity to receive information about and have input to project proposals. It also allows TRCA to identify and consider the concerns and issues of those communities (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 49).
*   **Consultation with MECP**: Prior to notifications, the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) is contacted for advice on which Indigenous communities should be engaged (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 49). The Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation (MIRR) and the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MOECC) were also contacted for advice and information on the Indigenous communities that should be contacted during the Indigenous Engagement process (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, p. 292).
*   **Respectful Communication**: The communication process respects the culture and practices of the Indigenous communities being engaged. Open dialogue and regular opportunities for feedback are incorporated to ensure meaningful engagement (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, p. 46).
*   **Record of Consultation**: A full record of Indigenous community consultation, including copies of all correspondence, can be found in the Record of Indigenous Engagement for specific projects (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, p. 50).
*   **Communities of Interest**: Several Indigenous communities are known to have an interest in the study area, including Beausoleil First Nation, Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, Chippewas of Rama First Nation, Conseil de la Nation Huronne-Wendat, Curve Lake First Nation, Hiawatha First Nation, Mississaugas of Alderville First Nation, and Mississaugas of Scugog First Nation (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, p. 47).
*   **Specific Projects**: For the German Mills Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project, a summary of the Indigenous engagement conducted is available (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, p. 293).
*   **Notifications**: Notification packages are couriered and emailed to Indigenous communities (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, p. 296).
*   **TRCA Guidelines**: Indigenous Engagement at TRCA is guided by TRCA Engagement Guidelines (2015) (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, p. 293).
*   **Summary of Correspondence**: Includes a letter to the community, study area maps, and a brief overview of the project (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, p. 297).
