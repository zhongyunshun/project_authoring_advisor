#### What are the specific erosion and sediment control measures implemented during the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project? ####
The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project implements erosion and sediment control measures, including:

*   Isolating staging and stockpiling areas with standard silt socks to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 32; HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 33).

Could you please specify which phase of the project (Phase I or Phase II) you are interested in, or if you'd like a general overview of all phases?
