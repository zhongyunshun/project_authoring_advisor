Query: #### What are the key considerations for the location of the long-term stable slope crest (LTSSC) in the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project? ####
Response: Key considerations for the location of the long-term stable slope crest (LTSSC) in the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project include:
- The location of the projected long-term stable slope crest (LTSSC) in relation to permanent and essential structures at the top of slope (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 16).
- The presence of a public footpath at the base of slope (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 16).
- The presence of potentially impacted infrastructure located within the tributary and surrounding area (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 16).
