The German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection project involves several key stakeholders. Here's a breakdown of their roles based on the provided documents:

*   **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA):** TRCA plays a central role in the project, including Erosion Risk Management (ERM). TRCA is working in partnership with the Regional Municipality of York to undertake sanitary infrastructure protection works (Document 2, 8, 9, 20). TRCA's Infrastructure Hazard Monitoring Program (IHMP) identified and monitored at-risk sanitary sites along German Mills Creek (Document 20). TRCA also engages with First Nations regarding the project (Document 3).

*   **York Region Environmental Services (the “Region”):** York Region partners with TRCA in preparing sanitary infrastructure protection works (Document 2, 8, 9, 20).

*   **GRECK AND ASSOCIATES LIMITED:** This firm is involved in the Schedule B Municipal Class Environmental Assessment, including the evaluation of alternatives for Sites 2 and 3 (Document 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19).

*   **Palmer Environmental Consulting Group:** This group collaborated with Greck and Associates Limited on a geomorphic assessment and preliminary design alternatives (Document 6).

The documents do not provide explicit details on how each stakeholder ensures project success. However, based on their roles, we can infer that success depends on:

*   **TRCA's** effective monitoring, risk management, and partnership with York Region.
*   **York Region's** collaboration and support in implementing the protection works.
*   **Greck and Associates Limited's** thorough environmental assessment and evaluation of alternatives.
*   **Palmer Environmental Consulting Group's** geomorphic expertise in design alternatives.

To provide a more comprehensive answer, further information would be needed regarding the specific agreements, responsibilities, and communication protocols between these stakeholders.
