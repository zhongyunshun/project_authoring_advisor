The Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC) is defined in the context of the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project as the modeled natural regression of a slope crest resulting from erosion forces, based on the composition and conditions of substrate materials (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 16).

Cole Engineering Group Ltd. conducted a subsurface investigation in 2015 to delineate the LTSSC behind Peacham Crescent using a factor of safety (FoS) of 1.5 (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 16). The location of the projected LTSSC is considered in relation to permanent and essential structures at the top of the slope, the presence of a public footpath at the base of the slope, and the presence of potentially impacted infrastructure within the tributary and surrounding area (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 16).
