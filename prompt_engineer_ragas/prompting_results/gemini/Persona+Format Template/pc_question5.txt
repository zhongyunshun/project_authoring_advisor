The provided documents focus on the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project. While they detail the existing slope instability and proposed remedial works, they do not explicitly mention future plans or subsequent phases for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope. To determine if there are future plans, additional documents or sources specifically addressing long-term plans for the area would be needed.
