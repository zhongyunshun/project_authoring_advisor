Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of how the Humber Bay Park East (HBPE) Shoreline Maintenance Project Phase II, as detailed in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" documents, impacts local wildlife, especially aquatic species mentioned in the baseline inventory:

**Baseline Inventory and Aquatic Species (Document 1, 6, 10, 14):**

*   The baseline inventory includes data on aquatic species present in the area.
*   Document 1 lists Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt as common species.
*   Documents 10 & 14 provide a more detailed list, including Round Goby (invasive), Shorthead Redhorse (native), Smallmouth Bass (native), Spotfin Shiner (native), Spottail Shiner (native), Rainbow Smelt (native/introduced), Rainbow Trout (introduced), and Rock Bass (native).

**Impacts of Shoreline Maintenance (Documents 3, 13):**

*   **Aquatic Habitat Alteration & Loss:** Documents 3, 13, and 22 explicitly mention the potential for aquatic habitat alteration and loss due to the construction. The construction involves shoreline protection structures, which can directly impact fish habitat.
*   **Minimizing Disturbance:**  Document 3 states that the protection structures were designed to minimize cutting and disturbing native material, implying an awareness of the potential negative impacts on the existing habitat.
* **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Document 16 mentions the use of silt socks to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse during construction. This is a measure to protect aquatic life from sedimentation and pollution.

**Mitigation and Habitat Enhancement (Documents 8, 17, 18, 20):**

*   **Habitat Features:** Discussions are underway to develop aquatic habitat features as part of the design (Document 8).
*   **Surcharged Revetment:** Surcharged stone is being installed at the base of the revetment to provide habitat (Document 18), and a similar approach is planned for Phase II.
*   **Site Restoration and Planting:** Final site restoration, including planting, will occur after the project phases are complete (Document 17). Document 20 mentions on-site compensation plantings to mitigate project impacts.

**Overall Assessment:**

The documents acknowledge the potential for negative impacts on aquatic habitat and species due to the shoreline maintenance project. However, they also highlight efforts to mitigate these impacts through careful design, erosion control measures, and habitat restoration/enhancement strategies. The project aims to minimize disturbance during construction and to create or improve aquatic habitat through the installation of specific features.

**In Summary:**

*   **Potential Negative Impacts:** Habitat alteration/loss, disturbance during construction, potential for sedimentation.
*   **Mitigation Measures:** Design to minimize disturbance, erosion and sediment control, habitat restoration with surcharged revetments and plantings.
