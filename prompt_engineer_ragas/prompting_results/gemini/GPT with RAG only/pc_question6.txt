Based on the provided documents from the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP," here's a summary of the anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project and how they are addressed:

**Potential Environmental Impacts:**

*   **Wildlife Habitat:** The project considers potential impacts on wildlife habitat. (Document 1)
*   **Habitat Linkages/Corridors:** The project considers potential impacts on habitat linkages and corridors. (Document 1)
*   **Vegetation Communities:** The project considers potential impacts on significant vegetation communities. (Document 1)
*   **Wetlands:** There were wetland vegetation communities observed along the southern limits of the project area. (Document 9)
*   **Existing Natural Habitat:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible and occur outside key migration/breeding windows to minimize impacts on existing natural habitat. A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented. (Document 18)
*   **Unique Landforms:** The project area has no known unique landforms, so no impacts are anticipated. (Document 10, 12)
*   **Erosion:** The project aims to address erosion and slope instability. (Document 3, 19)
*   **Drainage and Stormwater Runoff:** The selected alternative provides an opportunity to address drainage and stormwater runoff concerns. (Document 8)

**Potential Social Impacts:**

*   **Public Safety:** The project considers potential risks to public safety, especially along trails and on the slope, and the requirement for safety features like fences. (Document 11)
*   **Property Accessibility:** The project considers access route options to the slope behind specific properties. (Document 6)
*   **Surrounding Neighborhood/Community:** The project considers potential impacts on the surrounding neighborhood or community. (Document 7)
*   **Surrounding Land Uses/Growth Pressure:** The project considers potential impacts on surrounding land uses or growth pressure. (Document 7)
*   **Existing Infrastructure:** The project considers potential impacts on existing infrastructure. (Document 7)
*   **Recreational Uses:** The parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent is actively used for recreational purposes. (Document 13)
*   **Tourism:** There are no existing tourism operations within or adjacent to the project limits, so no impacts are anticipated. (Document 6)
*   **Public Consultation:** Public consultation occurred with the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018, and notices were sent to community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities. (Document 4)

**Mitigation and Management Strategies:**

*   **Class EA Process:** The project is being completed in accordance with the Class Environmental Assessment for Remedial Flood and Erosion Control Projects, amended 2013 (Class EA). (Document 5)
*   **Minimizing Construction Footprint:** Construction activities will have the smallest construction footprint possible. (Document 18)
*   **Timing of Activities:** Construction will occur outside of key migration and breeding windows. (Document 18)
*   **Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented. (Document 18)
*   **Risk Mitigation:** The project aims to mitigate risks associated with slope erosion. (Document 8)
*   **Addressing Drainage:** The selected alternative addresses drainage and stormwater runoff. (Document 8)
*   **Public Consultation:** The project involves public notifications and consultation. (Document 4)
*   **Safety Features:** The project considers the need for safety features like fences. (Document 11)

In summary, the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project's Class EA Project Plan identifies a range of potential environmental and social impacts and proposes mitigation measures such as minimizing the construction footprint, timing activities to avoid sensitive periods, implementing a restoration plan, addressing drainage issues, and engaging in public consultation. The project aims to protect human life and property from valley slope erosion while minimizing negative impacts on the environment and the community.
