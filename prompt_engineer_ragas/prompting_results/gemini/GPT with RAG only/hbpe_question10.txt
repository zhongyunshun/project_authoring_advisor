Based on the provided documents, the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" (not Phase I as mentioned in the query, but assuming this is the relevant document since Phase I is not present) outlines a preliminary planting plan that involves planting 280 trees. The documents generally discuss restoration plantings as a means to:

*   **Enhance overall biodiversity:** (Document 2) Restoration activities focus on replanting suitable native species to compensate for removals and improve biodiversity.
*   **Improve native species representation:** (Document 5) Ecological gain is expected from improving native species representation through restoration plantings.
*   **Support native terrestrial ecosystem habitat:** (Document 10) Restoration supports local biodiversity and resiliency by incorporating native vegetation.
*   **Enhance the ecological health:** (Document 12) Restoration plantings are intended to improve the ecological health of the surrounding community.

While the documents highlight the general benefits of restoration plantings for biodiversity, they **do not specifically mention how the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" plantings will contribute to or mitigate against biodiversity loss concerning species at risk.** The documents focus more on general habitat restoration and the use of native species.

To answer the query more directly, additional information would be needed about:

*   **Specific species being planted in Phase II:** Knowing the species would allow for an assessment of their value to local biodiversity and any potential benefits for species at risk.
*   **Presence of species at risk in the project area:** Understanding which species at risk might be present would allow for an evaluation of whether the plantings provide suitable habitat or resources for those species.
*   **Specific goals of the Phase II planting plan:** Knowing the objectives of the planting plan (e.g., creating specific habitat types) would help determine its impact on biodiversity and species at risk.
