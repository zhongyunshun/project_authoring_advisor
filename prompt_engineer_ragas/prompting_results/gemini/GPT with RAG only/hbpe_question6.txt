Based on the provided documents, here's how the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project addresses potential social impacts and ensures the safety of the local community:

*   **Public Safety:** The project considers the potential risks to the public, especially along trails and the slope itself. It includes requirements for safety features such as safety fences (Document 3).
*   **Pedestrian Traffic:** The project acknowledges the presence of an active paved pedestrian pathway behind Peacham Crescent and plans to temporarily restrict pedestrian traffic during construction (Document 9).
*   **Public Consultation:** The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) initiated public contact through a Notice of Intent and sent notices to community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities (Document 18).
*   **Property Accessibility:** The project proposes access route options to the slope behind specific properties (Document 7).
*   **Risk Mitigation:** The project aims to protect human life and property from erosion and slope instability (Document 5).
*   **Impact Assessment:** The project includes an assessment of potential effects on the surrounding neighborhood or community and surrounding land uses or growth pressure (Document 16).
