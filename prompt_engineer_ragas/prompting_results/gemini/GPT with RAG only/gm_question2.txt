Based on the provided documents, here's a summary of the measures taken in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project to protect and minimize disruption to local wildlife, particularly aquatic species:

*   **Aquatic Habitat Alteration & Loss Mitigation:** The design minimizes cutting and disturbing native material, assuming potential contamination of the shoreline (Document 2).
*   **Aquatic Habitat Components:** Discussions are underway between TRCA, DFO, City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design (Document 7). The proposed habitat component consists of a surcharged revetment (Document 7).
*   **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures:** Prior to construction, staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated with silt socks to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse (Documents 8, 9).
*   **Tree Protection:** Tree protection barriers will be erected where necessary, avoiding grade changes and material/equipment storage within the Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) (Document 12).
*   **Site Restoration:** Disturbed areas are to be restored to existing conditions or better and vegetated (Document 12).
*   **Monitoring:** TRCA's Aquatic Monitoring and Management (AMM) Group regularly collects fish population data using electrofishing at three monitoring stations near Humber Bay Park East (Document 21). Post-construction monitoring will occur after major storm events and annually to ensure the works are stable (Document 22).
*   **Relocation of Bird Nesting Boxes:** Bird nesting boxes within the staging area will be relocated (Document 5).

The baseline inventory identified species like Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt (Document 1). The project also considers invasive species like the Round Goby (Document 15). These measures aim to protect the habitats of these species and minimize the impact of construction on their populations.
