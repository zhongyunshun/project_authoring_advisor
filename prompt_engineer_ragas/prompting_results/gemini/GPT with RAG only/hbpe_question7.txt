    "answer": "Based on the provided documents, the selection of erosion control structures in the \"Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief\" considers both effectiveness and environmental impact. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Addressing Erosion Concerns:** The primary goal is to address erosion concerns, including low crest elevation and wave overtopping (Document 5). Proposed concepts are designed to place new material over existing structures where toe and slope stability permits, minimizing excavation (Document 5).\n\n*   **Structure Conditions and Deficiencies:** The condition of existing structures (e.g., armourstone headlands) is assessed to determine deficiencies such as displacement of armourstone, scouring, and backshore erosion (Documents 2, 3). The cobble/gravel beach (WF11.11) is noted to have slumping, undercutting, scouring, and material displacement (Documents 18, 22).\n\n*   **Material Selection and Environmental Impact:**\n    *   Smaller cobble sizes are considered for beaches to offer a user-friendly environment, but it's noted that they require more material and have a larger in-water footprint, potentially leading to higher costs and maintenance needs (Document 11).\n    *   The designs aim to minimize cutting and disturbing native material to avoid potential contamination (Document 19).\n\n*   **Specific Structure Design Elements:**\n    *   The design includes creating a berm with armourstone at the eastern limit of the headland to create a formal outlet for ponds (Document 8).\n    *   Repair of the pond outlet area involves an armourstone berm for drainage, with excavation, geotextile base placement, core stone, and toe stones (Document 12).\n    *   An armourstone node and retaining wall system are used at the eastern headland transition to preserve and protect the area (Document 21).\n\n*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Silt socks are used to isolate staging and stockpiling areas to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse during construction (Documents 9, 10).\n\nIn summary, the approach involves assessing existing structure conditions, selecting materials that balance effectiveness and environmental impact (considering factors like footprint and potential for contamination), and implementing erosion and sediment control measures during construction. The designs also aim to minimize excavation and disturbance of native material."
