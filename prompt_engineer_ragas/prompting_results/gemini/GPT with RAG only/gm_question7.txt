Okay, I will analyze the provided documents and synthesize a response detailing the decision-making process behind choosing specific erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches, considering their effectiveness and environmental impact, based on the provided text.

Here's the synthesized response:

The documents reveal several key considerations in the decision-making process for selecting erosion control structures like armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches:

**1. Effectiveness in Erosion Control & Shoreline Stabilization:**

*   **Armourstone Revetments/Headlands:** These are frequently used to protect the shoreline from erosion (Documents 4, 5).  The size and placement of armour stones are critical to their effectiveness. The Hudson equation is used to select armour stone sizes for stability (Documents 1, 2, 6).  Factors considered include wave conditions (Document 20), crest elevations, and the nature of placement (Documents 4, 5).  Revetments stabilize the shoreline (Document 2). Different options for remediation of revetments are considered, including rebuilding with existing armour stone or supplementing existing structures (Documents 10, 11). Overtopping rates are also considered in the design (Document 15).
*   **Cobble/Rubble Beaches:** Smaller cobble sizes are considered for a more user-friendly beach environment (Document 3). However, more material is required to provide sufficient protection, leading to higher costs, a greater in-water footprint, and increased maintenance needs (Document 3). The size of the cobble ranges from 10-100mm (Document 8).

**2. Environmental Impact:**

*   **Minimizing Disturbance:** One key factor in selecting erosion control methods is minimizing disturbance to the shoreline (Document 22).  Option 2 (supplementing existing structures) was chosen over complete rebuilds to reduce disturbance, the risk of exposing existing fill material, and construction costs/time (Document 22).
*   **Habitat Preservation/Creation:** The design can be updated to preserve fish habitat, for example, by changing a revetment design to an embayment/headland structure (Document 20). Surcharge stone can be used at the toe of a revetment to act as aquatic habitat (Document 20).  The repair of the Eastern Headland Transition includes establishing a backshore armourstone wall and headland to create a small habitat embayment (Document 9).
*   **Vegetated Boulder Revetments:** These are used to provide a more natural and cost-efficient means of protection (Documents 16, 17).

**3. Cost and Maintenance:**

*   **Cost Considerations:** The cost of materials (e.g., the quantity of cobble required) is a significant factor (Document 3).  Opting to supplement existing structures is also a cost-saving measure (Document 22).
*   **Maintenance Needs:** Smaller cobble beaches have a greater potential for maintenance needs (Document 3).

**4. Public Use & Safety:**

*   **User-Friendly Design:** The choice of smaller cobble sizes reflects a consideration for a more user-friendly beach environment for park users (Document 3).
*   **Addressing Safety Risks:** Large voids and scouring can threaten the stability of structures and present public safety risks (Document 12). The erosion control structures aim to mitigate these risks.

**5. Existing Conditions & Assessments:**

*   **Site-Specific Design:**  Conceptual design options are based on assessments and conditions of the shoreline (Documents 10, 11).  The size of armour stones and crest elevations vary considerably based on site conditions (Documents 4, 5).
*   **Addressing Existing Damage:**  Damage from wave overtopping and erosion is considered when selecting remediation strategies (Document 14).

**6. Collaboration with Authorities:**

*   **Consultation with TRCA:** Decisions are made in consultation with the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) (Document 22). TRCA also monitors the structures on an annual basis (Document 7).

In summary, the selection of erosion control structures involves a multi-faceted decision-making process that balances the need for effective shoreline protection with environmental considerations, cost, public use, and site-specific conditions. Collaboration with regulatory bodies like the TRCA is also crucial.
