Based on the provided documents and focusing on the "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final" (Documents 6, 9, and 14), the key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives were:

*   **Factor of Safety (FOS):** The stabilization options were developed based on a Factor of Safety (FOS) of 1.3 as requested by TRCA (Document 9).
*   **Stabilization of the Upper Slope:** All options included stabilization of the upper 3 to 6 m portion of the slope where the slope failure occurred (Document 9).
*   **Subsurface Conditions:** The conceptual designs considered the subsurface information, noting that the slope behind 21, 23, & 25 Peacham Crescent predominantly consists of very loose to compact/soft to stiff earth fill materials (Document 14).
*   **Topographic data:** Designs utilized topographic data provided by TRCA (Document 14).
