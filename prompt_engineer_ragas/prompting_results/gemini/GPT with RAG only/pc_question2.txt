Based on the provided documents, here's a summary of measures proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife during the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project:

*   **Timing of Construction:** Construction activities are planned to occur outside of key migration and breeding windows to minimize habitat use impact. (Document 3, 18)
*   **Minimizing Construction Footprint:** Efforts are being made to have the smallest construction footprint possible to reduce impacts on existing natural habitat. (Document 3)
*   **Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented. (Document 3)
*   **Sediment Control:** Sediment control fencing will be used to isolate the work area and prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse. The fencing will be maintained throughout construction until the site is stabilized. (Document 8)
*   **Tree Removal:** Tree removal will be minimal and highly selective to minimize impacts to vegetation communities. (Document 13, 18)
*   **Bird Habitat:** Construction activities will occur outside of the bird breeding window to minimize impacts on breeding bird activities. (Document 18)

While the documents mention a terrestrial biological survey (Documents 4, 6) that inventoried flora and fauna, and the identification of exotic plant species (Document 18), they don't provide specific details on measures targeted towards those specific species identified, beyond the general mitigation strategies listed above. Document 1 states "There are no significant wildlife populations identified within the Project limits; therefore, there are no anticipated impacts resulting from the proposed works."
