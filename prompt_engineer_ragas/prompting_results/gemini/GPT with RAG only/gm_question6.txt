Based on the provided documents, here's how the erosion hazard management in German Mills Settlers Park plans to address potential social impacts:

*   **Public Safety:** The documents highlight the potential risks to trail and park users due to erosion, necessitating safety features like fences (Document 7). Addressing erosion is crucial for maintaining public safety within the park (Document 1).
*   **Preserving Public Enjoyment:** The project aims to enhance the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic habitat of German Mills Park while preserving the public enjoyment of the natural space (Document 3).
*   **Recreational Activities:** Erosion along German Mills Creek poses a risk to trail infrastructure, which is a potential safety hazard to park users and their recreational activities (Document 1).
*   **Maintaining Access:** Bank and bed erosion pose a threat to maintenance access (Document 10).
*   **Social and Cultural Environment:** The primary objectives of the project consider the benefits or detriments to the social and cultural environment (Document 21).
