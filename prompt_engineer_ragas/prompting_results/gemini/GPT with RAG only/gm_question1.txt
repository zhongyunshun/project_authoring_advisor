Based on the provided documents, a comprehensive explanation of the "Slope Stability Analysis" methodology and its impact on project decisions in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project is not fully available. However, we can infer some key aspects from the documents:

**1. Methodology Components (Inferred):**

*   **Slope Stability & Erosion Risk Assessment:** Document 1 references a "SLOPE STABILITY & EROSION RISK ASSESSMENT" conducted by Cole Engineering (2015). This suggests a formal assessment was carried out.
*   **Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC):** Document 4 mentions the location of the projected LTSSC in relation to structures. Document 10 states that the LTSSC projected behind Peacham Crescent has a factor of safety of 1.5. This indicates that the analysis involved calculating and projecting the long-term stable slope position and ensuring a certain factor of safety.
*   **Factor of Safety:** A factor of safety of 1.5 (Document 10) suggests a quantitative approach to slope stability analysis. The factor of safety is a ratio of resisting forces to driving forces; a value greater than 1 indicates stability.
*   **Consideration of Infrastructure:** Document 4 shows that the presence of impacted infrastructure located within the tributary and surrounding area was considered.
*   **Historical Aerial Photographs:** Historical aerial photographs from 1946, 1952 and 1967 were used, according to Documents 15, 21, 22, and 20.

**2. Impact on Project Decisions (Inferred):**

*   **Justification for Intervention:** The "BACKGROUND" section in Document 2 states the analysis provides justification for TRCA's involvement and approach to developing a remedial solution.
*   **Project Objectives:** Document 9 mentions that the selected alternative meets all three project objectives, including risk mitigation. The slope stability analysis likely informed the risk mitigation strategies.
*   **Alternative Selection:** Document 9 indicates that the analysis results influenced the selection of a preferred alternative for slope stabilization. The chosen alternative had less impact on existing vegetation and addressed drainage concerns.
*   **Design Rationale:** Documents 12 refers to Section 5 â€“ Remediation Design in the Detailed Design Brief (Terraprobe, 2020) for further details on the design rationale for the scope of work.
*   **Environmental Analysis:** Document 13 refers to a detailed environmental analysis of the preferred alternative for slope stabilization.

**Limitations & Further Information Needed:**

*   **Specific Analytical Methods:** The documents do not explicitly detail the specific slope stability analysis methods used (e.g., limit equilibrium methods like Bishop's Simplified Method, Morgenstern-Price, or finite element analysis).
*   **Soil Parameters:** There is no mention of specific soil parameters (e.g., shear strength, cohesion, friction angle) used in the analysis.
*   **Detailed Design Brief:** Documents 12 refer to Terraprobe's "Detailed Design Brief," which would likely contain more specific details about the analysis.

In summary, the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project involved a slope stability analysis that considered factors like erosion risk, LTSSC, factor of safety, impacted infrastructure and historical aerial photographs. The results of this analysis informed project decisions related to justifying the project, selecting a stabilization alternative, achieving project objectives, and the design rationale. However, the provided documents lack specific details about the analytical methods and soil parameters used.
