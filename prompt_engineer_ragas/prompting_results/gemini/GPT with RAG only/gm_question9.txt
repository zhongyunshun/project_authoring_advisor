*   **Opportunity for Input:** Indigenous engagement is intended to provide Indigenous communities with an opportunity to receive information about and have input into project proposals (Document 3).
*   **Identification of Concerns:** Engagement allows TRCA to identify and address potential concerns from Indigenous communities (Document 3, Document 13).
*   **Consultation Based on Interest:** TRCA consults with communities based on asserted or established interest (Document 9).

*   **Notification:** Notices are sent to Indigenous communities regarding projects (Document 19).
*   **Record Keeping:** TRCA keeps records of Indigenous community consultation, including correspondence (Document 13).

**In summary,** TRCA has established guidelines and processes for engaging with Indigenous communities on projects within their jurisdiction.
