#### In light of the findings from the Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, what specific measures are proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, especially concerning species identified in the vicinity? ####
Based on the provided documents related to the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, here's a summary of the measures proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife:

1.  **Limited Impact Anticipation:** The documents state that there are no significant wildlife populations identified within the Project limits, suggesting that no significant impacts are anticipated from the proposed works (Document 1).

2.  **Minimizing Construction Footprint:** To minimize impacts on existing natural habitat, all construction activities are planned to have the smallest construction footprint as possible (Document 3).

3.  **Timing of Construction Activities:** Construction is planned to occur outside of key migration and breeding windows when habitat use is not as crucial (Document 3).

4.  **Comprehensive Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented, though specific details of this plan are not provided in the given documents (Document 3).

5.  **Mitigation of Bird Habitat Impacts:** Construction activities will occur outside of the bird breeding window to avoid impacting breeding bird activities. The removal of select canopy trees will be minimal (Document 18).

6.  **Sediment Control Measures:** Standard sediment control fencing will be used to isolate the Work Area prior to the start of construction to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse (Document 8).

7.  **Addressing Drainage and Stormwater Runoff:** The selected alternative addresses drainage and stormwater runoff concerns within the Project limits (Document 5).

8.  **Erosion and Slope Instability Management**: Dense vegetation along ravine slopes helps to disperse the energy of overland runoff, secure soil materials, and contribute to water absorption, ultimately reducing the overall impact of erosional (Document 16).

9.  **Terrestrial Biological Survey**: A terrestrial biological survey of the natural area within and surrounding the Project area was undertaken by TRCAâ€™s Environmental Monitoring and Data Management (EMDM) to inventory existing flora and fauna (Document 4).

These measures collectively aim to minimize disturbance to wildlife and their habitats during the project.
