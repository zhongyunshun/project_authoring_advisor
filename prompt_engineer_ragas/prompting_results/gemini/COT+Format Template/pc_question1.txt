#### How does the Slope Stability and Erosion Risk Assessment define "Long-Term Stable Slope Crests" (LTSSC), and what criteria are used to determine these in the context of the Peacham Crescent projects? ####
The Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC) is defined in the context of the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project as follows:

1.  **Definition**: The LTSSC models the natural regression of a slope crest resulting from erosion forces and is based on the composition and conditions of substrate materials (Document 2).
2.  **Determination Criteria**:

    *   Subsurface Investigation: Cole Engineering Group Ltd. conducted a subsurface investigation to delineate the LTSSC behind Peacham Crescent (Document 2).
    *   Factor of Safety (FoS): A factor of safety of 1.5 was used in the 2015 Slope Stability & Erosion Risk Assessment (SS&ERA) to determine the LTSSC (Documents 2, 4, 9, and 10). However, a factor of safety of 1.3 was also used, as seen in Figure 3 of the Conceptual Alternatives Report (Document 3).
    *   Geotechnical Investigation: Soil Engineers Ltd. conducted borehole drilling to evaluate the LTSSC (Document 8).
    *   Consideration of Risk: The LTSSC is evaluated to mitigate risk to infrastructure, private property, and human life (Document 8). The positioning of the LTSSC is also assessed to avoid intersecting residential dwellings, as was the case at 21 Peacham Crescent, where the LTSSC (for a Factor of Safety of 1.5) would have intersected the residential dwelling (Document 6).

In summary, the LTSSC is determined based on erosion forces, substrate composition, subsurface investigations, geotechnical data, and a factor of safety to ensure slope stability and minimize risks to property and human life.
