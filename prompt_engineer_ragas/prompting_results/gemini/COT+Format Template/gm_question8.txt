#### What are the specific types of erosion control structures used in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, and what materials are they made of? ####
        
Based on the provided documents, the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project involves several erosion control structures. Here's what the documents specify:
        
1.  **Armourstone Headlands:** The project includes maintenance and repair of armourstone headlands, such as the Western Armourstone Headland (WF11.10). These structures use armourstone (large rocks) to protect the shoreline from erosion. (Source: Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 5)
        
2.  **Erosion Control Structures:** The documents mention the condition of three erosion control structures within the project area, but do not specify the exact types or materials of all structures. Photos and sketches of these structures are available in Figures 3 through 12 of the Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf. (Source: Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 5)
        
3.  **Rip Rap:** Rip rap is mentioned in the context of scouring in areas above the headland due to overtopping. (Source: Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 5)
        
To provide a more detailed answer, additional information would be needed, such as the specific figures referenced or a comprehensive list of all structure types and materials used in each phase of the project.
