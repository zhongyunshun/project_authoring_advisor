#### What sustainable development practices are being implemented in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project to ensure long-term environmental conservation? ####
The documents related to the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project outline several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation:

1.  **Minimizing Excavation:** The project aims to minimize excavation requirements by placing new material over existing structures where toe and slope stability permits. This reduces disturbance to the native material composition of the shoreline (Document 6, 17).
2.  **Erosion Control:** Addressing erosion concerns is a primary focus, including low crest elevation and wave overtopping. The proposed concepts are designed to address these concerns, providing long-term protection to the Humber Bay Park East shoreline (Document 6, 10).
3.  **Climate Change Considerations:** Research on climate change and its expected effects on the Great Lakes is considered. The project accounts for the consensus that water levels are expected to fall while severe storm frequency and intensity are expected to increase (Document 14, 15).
4.  **Habitat Protection:** The protection structures are designed to minimize cutting and disturbing native material, considering the potential for contamination (Document 17).
5.  **Site Restoration:** Restoration includes regrading and seeding, with a full Restoration Plan to be part of the detailed designs for the final phase of the project. Plantings will occur after implementation (Document 5, 22).
6.  **Post-Construction Monitoring:** The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and annually thereafter to ensure that the implemented works are stable and performing as designed. Any required maintenance will be performed (Document 12, 18).
