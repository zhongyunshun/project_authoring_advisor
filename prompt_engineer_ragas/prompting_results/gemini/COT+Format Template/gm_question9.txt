#### In the development and implementation of TRCA projects like those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay, how are local Indigenous communities consulted or involved? ####
TRCA engages with Indigenous communities through various methods, aiming for meaningful and mutually respectful relationships. Here's a breakdown of how Indigenous communities are consulted and involved in TRCA projects:

1.  **Engagement Methods**:
    *   **Informal Partnerships**: TRCA may engage in informal partnerships with Indigenous communities for various initiatives.
    *   **Formal Engagement**: For TRCA projects subject to legislation requiring engagement, formal processes are followed.
    *   **Varied Forms of Engagement**: Engagement forms can differ based on the project scope and the interests of each community. These include providing information, seeking input, and identifying potential impacts. (Document 3)

2.  **Objective of Engagement**:
    *   TRCA aims to develop positive relationships with Aboriginal communities whose interests may be impacted by TRCA projects. (Document 1)
    *   Engagement is intended to provide Indigenous communities with an opportunity to receive information and provide input on project proposals. (Document 3)
    *   TRCA also uses engagement to identify and address potential concerns from Indigenous communities. (Document 3)

3.  **Communities Involved**:
    *   TRCA consults with various First Nations and Indigenous organizations. Examples include:
        *   Beausoleil First Nation
        *   Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation

4.  **Specific Project Examples**:
    *   **Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project**: A full record of Indigenous community consultation, including correspondence, can be found in Appendix D of the project documentation. (Document 13)
    *   **German Mills Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project**: TRCA conducted Indigenous engagement during this project and summarized the correspondence with Indigenous communities. (Document 14)

5.  **Consultation Process**:
    *   **Preliminary Consultation**: It is important to discuss project proposals with TRCA early in the planning process to address potential impacts on TRCA's programs and policies. (Document 15, 18)
    *   **Notifications**: Notices are sent to community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities. (Document 19)

6.  **Addressing Concerns**:
    *   TRCA addresses concerns raised by Indigenous communities during the consultation process. (Document 13)
    *   For example, the Huron-Wendat Nation and Six Nations of the Grand River Territory requested archaeological assessments for a project, and no further concerns were raised after the assessments were provided. (Document 22)

7.  **TRCA's Recognition**:
    *   TRCA recognizes the importance of consulting with Aboriginal communities on planning matters that may affect their rights and interests. (Document 11)
