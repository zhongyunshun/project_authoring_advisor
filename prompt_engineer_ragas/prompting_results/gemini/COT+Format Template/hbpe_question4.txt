#### Can you elaborate on the roles and responsibilities of TRCA and the City of Toronto in the maintenance and administration of Humber Bay Park East as described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" ####
Based on the provided documents, here's what can be inferred about the roles of TRCA and the City of Toronto:

*   **TRCA (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority):** TRCA plays a central role in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project. They are responsible for project management, retaining engineering services (such as Shoreplan Engineering Limited), conducting archaeological assessments, and coordinating with other stakeholders. TRCA also owns Humber Bay Park East, making them responsible for the park's overall management.
*   **City of Toronto:** The City of Toronto is a key stakeholder in discussions regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design.

To provide a more comprehensive answer, additional information about the specific agreements or divisions of responsibilities between TRCA and the City of Toronto regarding the park's maintenance and administration would be needed.
