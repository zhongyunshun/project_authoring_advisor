#### Can you explain the methodology used for the "Slope Stability Analysis" detailed in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, and how it impacts project decisions? ####
The documents mention "SLOPE STABILITY & EROSION RISK ASSESSMENT" by Cole Engineering (2015) (Document 1, Document 16). Document 10 also references Cole Engineering Group Ltd., 2015, as the source for Figure 7, which depicts the Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC) projected behind Peacham Crescent with a factor of safety of 1.5.

To provide a detailed explanation of the methodology, it would be necessary to consult the referenced "SLOPE STABILITY & EROSION RISK ASSESSMENT" report by Cole Engineering (2015) and Section 5 â€“ Remediation Design in the Detailed Design Brief (Terraprobe, 2020) (Document 12). These documents would outline the specific methods used to assess slope stability and erosion risk.

Without access to these specific reports, I can only infer that the slope stability analysis likely involves geotechnical investigations, soil testing, hydrological assessments, and the application of engineering principles to determine the stability of the slope under various conditions. The results of this analysis would then be used to inform decisions about the design and implementation of slope stabilization measures.
