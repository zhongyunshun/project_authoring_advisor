#### How does the erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park plan to address potential social impacts, such as access to parklands and community recreational spaces? ####
Erosion hazard management in German Mills Settlers Park addresses potential social impacts, such as access to parklands and community recreational spaces, through several considerations:

*   **Public Safety:** Erosion along German Mills Creek poses a potential public health risk and a safety hazard to park users due to risks to trail infrastructure (Document 1). Management plans include safety features like safety fences to mitigate these risks (Document 7).

*   **Preservation of Public Enjoyment:** The secondary objective of the infrastructure protection project includes enhancing the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic habitat of German Mills Park while preserving public enjoyment of the natural space (Document 3).

*   **Impacts to Trail and Park Users:** Erosion management considers the potential risks to trail and park users, ensuring that design alternatives address public safety (Document 7).

*   **Recreational Activities:** The project aims to balance erosion control with the maintenance of recreational activities within the park (Document 1).

These measures ensure that erosion management strategies not only protect the sanitary infrastructure but also maintain the park's usability and safety for the community.
