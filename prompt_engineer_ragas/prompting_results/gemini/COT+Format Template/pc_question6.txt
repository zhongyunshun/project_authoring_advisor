Okay, I will use the provided documents to identify the anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, and how the project plan proposes to address them.

```
I will analyze the documents to extract information regarding potential impacts on:

Biological environment (wildlife habitat, vegetation, etc.)
Physical environment (landforms, erosion)
Socioeconomic factors (community, land use, infrastructure)
Public safety
Recreational uses

For each impact, I will identify the proposed mitigation measures outlined in the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" document.
