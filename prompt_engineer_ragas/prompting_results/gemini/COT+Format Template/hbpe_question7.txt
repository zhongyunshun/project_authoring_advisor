The documents provided detail the condition of existing erosion control structures and proposed maintenance, but they do not explicitly state the criteria used to initially select these structures based on effectiveness and environmental impact. However, the documents do provide some insight:

*   **Existing Conditions and Deficiencies:** The documents describe the current state of the erosion control structures, highlighting deficiencies such as displacement of armourstone, scouring, and overtopping (Document 3, Document 6). This suggests that the maintenance project aims to address these existing problems.

*   **Design Considerations:** The documents mention design considerations for new materials, such as cobble size for beaches, balancing user-friendliness with shoreline protection and potential maintenance needs (Document 11). This implies a consideration of both effectiveness and environmental impact in the design process.

*   **Minimizing Environmental Impact:** One document mentions minimizing the disturbance of native material during construction due to potential contamination (Document 19). This indicates an awareness of environmental impact during the project.

**In summary:** While the documents don't directly address the initial selection criteria, they do show that the current maintenance project considers the effectiveness of repairs in addressing existing structural deficiencies and incorporates environmental considerations in the design and construction phases.

To determine the *original* selection criteria, additional information would be needed, potentially from earlier planning documents or design specifications that predate the current maintenance project.
