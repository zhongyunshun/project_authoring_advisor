#### Can you detail any strategies outlined in the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" to promote sustainable development and conservation throughout the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project? ####
The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" outlines several strategies promoting sustainability and conservation:

1.  **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures:** The work area will be isolated with standard sediment control fencing to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse. These barriers will be inspected and maintained throughout construction until the site is stabilized (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 15).
2.  **Minimizing Construction Footprint:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26).
3.  **Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26).
4.  **Addressing Drainage and Stormwater Runoff:** The selected alternative provides an opportunity to address drainage and stormwater runoff concerns within the Project limits (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 44).
5.  **Tree Removals and Hazardous Plants Screening:** The document mentions "Required Tree Removals" and "Hazardous Plants Screening," indicating consideration for vegetation management (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 3).
