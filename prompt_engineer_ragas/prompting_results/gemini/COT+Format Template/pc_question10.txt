Here's an analysis of how the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project addresses biodiversity, focusing on bats and butternut trees, based on the provided documents:

**Butternut Trees:**

*   **Identification and Classification:** A Category 2 butternut tree has been identified within the project area, specifically along the proposed access route ("Document 1"). A Category 2 tree is defined as one not significantly affected by Butternut Canker ("Document 1").
*   **Endangered Species Status:** Butternut trees are classified as an endangered species in North America and are protected under Ontario’s Endangered Species Act ("Document 2").
*   **Genetic Testing and Susceptibility:** Genetic testing revealed that the butternut tree within the construction access route is genetically pure and highly susceptible to butternut canker ("Document 2").
*   **Species of Concern:** The presence of a butternut tree is noted as a species of concern, primarily due to the impact of butternut canker on butternut populations ("Document 19").

**Bat Species:**

*   **Habitat Presence:** Bat habitat is present within the project area ("Document 8").
*   **Compensation Measures:** Appropriate compensation for bat habitat will be coordinated by TRCA’s ERM Project staff, following the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol ("Document 8").

**General Biodiversity Considerations:**

*   **Minimal Impacts:** The project aims to minimize impacts on species of concern through selective tree and shrub removals ("Document 21").
*   **Restoration Activities:** Post-construction restoration activities will focus on replanting suitable native species to compensate for removals and enhance overall biodiversity ("Document 21").
*   **Exotic Species:** An ecology survey identified 16 exotic plant species within the expanded study area ("Document 3").
