#### In the "Design Brief - Phase II" document, what specific engineering challenges and considerations were addressed during the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East? ####
Based on the provided documents, the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East addressed the following engineering challenges and considerations:

1.  **Shoreline Protection Design**: The detailed design focused on shoreline protection for the eastern part of the site, from the beach area on the south side to the north-easterly headland of Humber Bay Park East, proceeding counterclockwise. The design was split into phases, with Phase 2 focusing on the southern headland and Phase 3 including the concrete rubble and gravel beach (Document 1, 2).

2.  **Coastal Conditions**: The design considered the coastal conditions along the shoreline, evaluating existing site conditions (Document 3, 4).

3.  **Erosion Concerns**: The design addressed leading erosion concerns, including low crest elevation and wave overtopping. New material was placed over existing structures where toe and slope stability permitted, minimizing excavation requirements (Document 14).

4.  **Water Levels**: Marine structures were designed using the 100-year return period instantaneous water level (Document 15).

5.  **Wave Overtopping**: Overtopping rates were estimated using methods for armored slopes and walls, as presented in the Overtopping Manual (EurOtop, 2018) (Document 16).

6.  **Aquatic Habitat**: The design aimed to minimize cutting and disturbing native material due to potential contamination of the shoreline's native material composition (Document 12).

7.  **Habitat Features**: Habitat features were installed as part of Phase I, with plans for a similar approach in Phase II, consisting of surcharged stone at the base of the revetment at several points along the deepest part of the structure (Document 21).
