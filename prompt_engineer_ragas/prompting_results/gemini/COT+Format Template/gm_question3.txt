Okay, I understand. I will use the provided documents and follow the specified steps to answer questions related to the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). I will prioritize information found within the documents, then supplement with web searches if necessary, and finally, use my own knowledge as a last resort. I will always cite my sources. I will also ask for clarifications if a query is ambiguous or requires more specific information.

Let's begin.
