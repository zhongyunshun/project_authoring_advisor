Here's an analysis of how tree removals and restoration plantings in projects like the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project affect biodiversity, especially concerning species at risk:

**Impact of Tree Removals:**

*   **Habitat Loss:** The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project necessitates the removal of trees. Specifically, 180 trees are slated for removal, and another 38 are expected to be injured to facilitate construction access and stabilization works. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 14)
*   **Minimal Impact to Bird Habitat:** The tree removals will be minimal and selective, resulting in minimal impacts to bird habitat. The construction activities will occur outside of the bird breeding window. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27)

**Restoration Plantings and Mitigation:**

*   **Compensation for Removals:** Post-construction restoration activities focus on replanting suitable native species to compensate for those that were removed and enhance the overall biodiversity of the Project area. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27)
*   **Ecological Gain:** An ecological gain from the perspective of improving native species representation is expected once restoration plantings of native species are established. (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 226)
*   **Soil Stabilization and Biodiversity:** The planted vegetation will provide increased soil stabilization, reduce surficial erosion, and add to the biodiversity of the local ecosystem once it becomes established. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 40)

**Species at Risk:**

*   **Butternut:** A Category 2 butternut has been identified within the project area and is generally located along the proposed access route. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 11) A genetic test determined that the butternut within the construction access route is genetically pure and therefore highly susceptible to butternut canker. (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27)
*   **Protection of Butternut:** Retaining the tree could support the protection or recovery of butternut in the area. (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief\_Final.pdf, page 11)

**Overall Assessment:**

The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project aims to minimize impacts on existing natural habitat. Construction activities are planned to have the smallest construction footprint as possible and occur outside of key migration and breeding windows when habitat use is not as crucial.
