#### Are there future phases or expansions planned for the erosion control and slope stabilization efforts discussed in the Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent projects? ####
Based on the provided documents:

*   **Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project:** The project is divided into three phases for design and implementation due to the extent of the project area and the multi-year nature of construction (Document 1, 9). Phase I focuses on the Eastern Headland (Document 5, 11, 14, 20, 22). Documents 17 and 18 refer to detailed design reports for Phases 1 & 2.

*   **Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project:** The project plan addresses erosion control and slope stabilization behind Peacham Crescent (Document 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21). However, the documents do not explicitly mention future phases or expansions beyond the scope of the current plan.

Therefore, while the Humber Bay Park East project is explicitly phased, the Peacham Crescent project's documentation does not detail any planned future phases or expansions.
