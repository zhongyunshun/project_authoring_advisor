#### How does the slope stabilization project on Peacham Crescent plan to address potential social impacts and ensure the safety of the local community ####
The Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project addresses potential social impacts and ensures public safety through several measures:

1.  **Public Safety:**
    *   The project aims to protect human life and property from erosion and slope instability hazards (Document 5).
    *   Potential risks to public safety, especially along trails and the slope, are assessed, and the requirement for safety features like safety fences is considered (Document 3).
2.  **Pedestrian Traffic:**
    *   An active paved pedestrian pathway runs through the parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent. Construction will require temporary restrictions to pedestrian traffic (Document 9).
3.  **Public Notification and Consultation:**
    *   As per the Class EA process, public contact includes publishing a Notice of Intent and sending notices to community groups, homeowners near the project site, and Indigenous communities (Document 18).
4.  **Property Accessibility:**
    *   Two access route options have been proposed to access the slope behind specific properties (Document 7).
5.  **Screening Criteria:**
    *   The project considers the surrounding neighborhood or community and surrounding land uses or growth pressure as part of its socioeconomic screening (Document 15).
    *   Impact to public safety (i.e., along trail and slope) and requirement for safety features (e.g., safety fences) (Document 3)
6.  **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Objective 1 of the project is risk mitigation (Document 4).

These measures indicate a comprehensive approach to managing social impacts and ensuring public safety during the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project.
