Okay, I understand. I will focus on extracting and synthesizing information related to wildlife protection and habitat preservation measures during the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, with a particular emphasis on aquatic species. I will prioritize information found within the provided documents and will clearly indicate the source of each piece of information.

#### What measures are being taken in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project to ensure the protection and minimal disruption of local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory? ####
        
Here's a summary of measures being taken to protect wildlife, particularly aquatic species, during the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, based on the provided documents:

*   **Aquatic Habitat Alteration & Loss:** The design minimizes cutting and disturbing of native material to reduce potential contamination of the shoreline (Document 2, Page 22; Document 4, Page 4).
*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Prior to construction, staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated using silt socks to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse (Document 8, Page 32; Document 9, Page 33).
*   **Aquatic Habitat Components:** Discussions are underway between TRCA, DFO, City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design. The proposed habitat component consists of a surcharged revetment (Document 7, Page 30).
*   **Tree Protection:** Tree protection barriers will be erected where necessary, and there will be no grade changes or storage of materials/equipment within the Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) (Document 12, Page 33).
*   **Site Restoration:** All disturbed areas are to be restored to existing conditions or better and will be vegetated (Document 12, Page 33).
*   **Monitoring:** The site will be inspected after major storm events and annually to ensure the implemented works are stable and performing as designed (Document 22, Page 37).
*   **Baseline Inventory:** A baseline inventory was conducted that included an aquatic inventory which identified Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt as common species (Document 1, Page 14). TRCA's Aquatic Monitoring and Management (AMM) Group regularly collects fish population data using electrofishing at three monitoring stations near Humber Bay Park East: Southern Beach, East Headland (Document 21, Page 19).
*   **Invasive Species Management**: The baseline inventory identified invasive species such as Round Goby (Document 15, Page 20).

These measures are designed to minimize the impact of the maintenance project on the local ecosystem and to protect the aquatic habitat and species within Humber Bay Park East.
