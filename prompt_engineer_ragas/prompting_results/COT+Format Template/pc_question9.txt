Indigenous communities were engaged in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project through a structured consultation approach outlined in the documentation provided by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). 

1. **Engagement Process**: The TRCA initiated public notifications and consultations, with the first point of contact being the publication of a Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018. Notices were sent to community groups, homeowners in the vicinity of the project site, and Indigenous communities, ensuring that relevant stakeholders were informed and given an opportunity to participate in the process (Document 2, page 48).

2. **Documentation of Concerns**: A full record of the Indigenous community consultation, including correspondence, is documented in the "Record of Indigenous Engagement" for the project. This record is detailed in Appendix D of the project plan, indicating that there was a systematic approach to gathering and addressing concerns raised by Indigenous groups (Document 1, page 50).

3. **Outcomes of Engagement**: While the documents indicate that no major concerns were raised about the project by the Indigenous communities (Document 1, page 50), it is essential to note that the consultation process serves as a critical part of ensuring that Indigenous voices are included in environmental assessments and project planning. The extent to which the input from Indigenous communities influenced specific project outcomes, however, is not explicitly detailed in the retrieved documents.

In summary, Indigenous communities were actively engaged through notifications and a formal consultation process, contributing to the planning of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project. The absence of major concerns may reflect a successful engagement process, although the specifics of how their input shaped project outcomes would require further exploration in the full records of engagement.
