3. **Indigenous Communities**:
   - Indigenous communities are recognized as stakeholders, and appropriate notifications are sent to them to ensure that their perspectives and rights are considered during the Class EA process (Document 3, p. 48).

4. **Public**:
   - The general public is engaged through a transparent process that includes public notifications and consultations. This engagement is essential for gathering feedback and ensuring that the project addresses community concerns (Document 3, p. 48).

5. **Environmental Consultants and Experts**:
   - Various environmental assessments and studies are conducted by consultants and experts to evaluate the project's potential impacts on the environment. This includes baseline inventories and analyses that inform the decision-making process (Document 10, p. 22; Document 16, p. 18).

6. **Minister of the Environment**:
   - The process may involve the Minister of the Environment, especially if there are significant concerns raised during the public consultation phase that warrant further review or intervention (Document 9, p. 49).
