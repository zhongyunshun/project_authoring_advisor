The erosion control and slope stabilization efforts for both the Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent projects are structured around phased approaches, indicating that future phases or expansions are indeed planned.

For the **Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project**, the project has been divided into three phases due to the extensive area and multi-year nature of construction. While specific details on the future phases beyond Phase I are not fully elaborated in the retrieved documents, the mention of a phased approach suggests ongoing and future expansions aimed at addressing erosion concerns along the park's shoreline (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 4).

Similarly, the **Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project** is outlined in a Class EA Project Plan that mentions various stages of project development. Although the details provided mainly focus on current assessments and existing conditions, the structured planning typically implies that future phases will be considered to address any ongoing or emerging erosion issues in the area (Source: Class EA Project Plan, 2019-09-26).
