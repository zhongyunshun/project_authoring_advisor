In light of the findings from the Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, specific measures proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife include:

1. **Minimizing Construction Footprint**: All construction activities are planned to have the smallest construction footprint possible. This approach helps to reduce the disturbance to existing natural habitats within the project area (Document 3, Page 26).

2. **Timing of Construction Activities**: To further minimize impacts, construction activities are scheduled to occur outside of key migration and breeding windows when habitat use is less critical. This timing is intended to avoid disrupting wildlife during important life stages (Document 3, Page 26).

3. **Selective Vegetation Removal**: The project plans to ensure that tree removal will be minimal and highly selective. This strategy is designed to maintain overall vegetation community health within the parkland corridor and reduce negative impacts on bird habitats, particularly through selective canopy tree removals (Document 13, Page 26; Document 18, Page 27).

4. **Monitoring and Management**: A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented to restore any disturbed areas post-construction, although specific details of this plan are not fully elaborated in the provided documents (Document 3, Page 26).

These measures are outlined to ensure that the project aligns with conservation objectives while addressing the need for slope stabilization and erosion control. The emphasis on timing and selective removal reflects an awareness of the ecological sensitivities present in the area. 

For further details or specific wildlife species of concern, referring to the full Ecology Survey Memorandum would be advisable, particularly for insights into species at risk and their habitat requirements.
