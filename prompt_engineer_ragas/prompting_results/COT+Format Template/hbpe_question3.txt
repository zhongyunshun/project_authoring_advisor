The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation. Here are some key practices based on the retrieved documents:

1. **Erosion Control Measures**: The project addresses significant erosion concerns by designing concepts that include placing new materials over existing structures where stability permits. This minimizes excavation and disturbance to the existing ecosystem (Document 6).

2. **Phased Approach**: The project is divided into three phases for design and implementation, allowing for careful planning and integration of sustainable practices at each stage. This phased approach enables adaptive management based on ongoing assessments (Document 3).

3. **Site Restoration and Monitoring**: Restoration efforts include regrading and seeding, with a full Restoration Plan developed for the final phase. This plan emphasizes the importance of restoring native plant species and habitats to enhance biodiversity (Document 22).

4. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: The site will undergo inspections during the first year after major storm events and annually thereafter to ensure that the implemented works are stable and performing as designed. This ongoing monitoring is crucial for long-term environmental conservation (Document 12).

5. **Climate Change Considerations**: The project acknowledges the impacts of climate change, such as rising storm frequency and intensity, and incorporates strategies that consider these factors in the design and construction processes (Document 14).

These practices reflect a commitment to sustainable development within the context of the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, aiming to protect and enhance the natural environment while addressing human impacts.
