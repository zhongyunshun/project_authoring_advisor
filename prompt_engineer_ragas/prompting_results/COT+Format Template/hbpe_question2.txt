The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" outlines several impacts on local wildlife, particularly aquatic species, as part of the shoreline maintenance projects at Humber Bay Park East. 

1. **Aquatic Habitat Alteration**: The project mentions that the proposed works may lead to alterations in fish habitats. Specifically, the construction activities could result in the loss of certain areas of aquatic habitat, which is critical for the species found in the area, such as Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt (Document 3, Page 22; Document 14, Page 18). 

2. **Monitoring and Assessment**: The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) has conducted baseline inventories that assess the existing aquatic species and their habitats, which inform the design and implementation of the project to mitigate adverse effects (Document 6, Page 17; Document 11, Page 14). 

3. **Conservation Measures**: The project includes provisions for environmental monitoring and data management to ensure that any impacts on aquatic species are tracked and mitigated during construction. This includes implementing erosion and sediment control measures to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourses, which is crucial for maintaining water quality and habitat integrity (Document 16, Page 33).

4. **Habitat Features**: As part of the habitat enhancement efforts, features such as surcharged revetments will be integrated into the project design, which aim to support aquatic life by creating suitable habitats (Document 18, Page 30).

5. **Mitigation Strategies**: The project includes plans for restoration plantings and habitat compensation measures, which involve planting native species to offset any habitat loss due to the construction activities (Document 20, Page 36).

Overall, while the maintenance works are necessary for the preservation and enhancement of the shoreline, careful planning and monitoring are essential to minimize impacts on the local aquatic species and their habitats.
