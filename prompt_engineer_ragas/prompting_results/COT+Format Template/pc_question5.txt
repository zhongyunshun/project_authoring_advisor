#### The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" does not explicitly mention any future plans or subsequent phases for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope at Peacham Crescent. The document primarily outlines the existing issues related to slope instability and details the remedial works proposed to address these issues for the properties located at 21, 23, 25, and 27 Peacham Crescent. If you require more specific information or updates on future plans, I recommend checking with the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) directly or reviewing subsequent documentation that may have been released post-2021. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
