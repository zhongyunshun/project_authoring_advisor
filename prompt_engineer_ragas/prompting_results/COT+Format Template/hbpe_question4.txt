The roles and responsibilities of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and the City of Toronto in the maintenance and administration of Humber Bay Park East, as outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I," include the following key points:

1. **TRCA's Responsibilities**:
   - The TRCA is primarily responsible for the overall management and conservation efforts within Humber Bay Park East, which includes overseeing the maintenance of park infrastructure and natural habitats.
   - The TRCA conducts various assessments, including archaeological assessments and environmental evaluations, to ensure that the project adheres to conservation standards and regulations.
   - The authority has retained Shoreplan Engineering Limited for engineering services, which indicates a collaborative approach to project execution and design (as detailed in the project brief).

2. **City of Toronto's Responsibilities**:
   - The City of Toronto plays a supportive role in the administration of the park, facilitating the TRCA's maintenance activities and ensuring compliance with municipal regulations.
   - The City may also be involved in public engagement initiatives, helping to communicate with park users and stakeholders about ongoing maintenance and improvements.

3. **Collaborative Efforts**:
   - There is an emphasis on collaboration between TRCA and the City of Toronto to address any community concerns and to enhance the recreational and ecological value of the park. This includes planning for future habitat development and shoreline protection measures as part of the maintenance project.

These responsibilities reflect a partnership aimed at ensuring the sustainability and safety of Humber Bay Park East for both ecological integrity and public enjoyment.
