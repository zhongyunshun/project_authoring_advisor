The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project aims to address potential social impacts and ensure community safety through various measures. According to the Class EA Project Plan, key points include:

1. **Public Safety Considerations**: The project assesses potential risks to public safety, particularly along the trail and slope areas. It has categorized these risks as low to moderate and plans to implement necessary safety features, such as safety fences, to mitigate these risks (Document 3, page 42).

2. **Community Engagement**: Public notifications and consultations are part of the project's process. The initial point of public contact was established through a Notice of Intent published on November 22, 2018, and continued engagement with community groups and local residents is maintained throughout the project (Document 18, page 48).

3. **Access and Traffic Management**: The project considers pedestrian traffic as there is an active paved pathway that runs through the parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent. During construction, pedestrian access will need to be temporarily restricted, indicating that the project will manage potential disruptions in a way that aims to minimize impact on community access (Document 9, page 36).

4. **Risk Mitigation**: The project has been initiated following the identification of slope failure risks behind residential properties on Peacham Crescent. This proactive approach reflects the project's commitment to protecting human life and property from erosion and slope instability hazards (Document 21, page 11).

Overall, the project is designed with a focus on safety, community involvement, and minimizing social impacts, thereby ensuring that the local community's needs are considered throughout the stabilization efforts.
