The anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, as outlined in the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP," include considerations related to biological, physical, and socioeconomic factors.

### Environmental Impacts:
1. **Biological Impacts**:
   - The project area is not expected to host significant wildlife populations, with no anticipated impacts resulting from proposed works. However, there are existing wetland vegetation communities observed, which may require careful monitoring during construction to avoid disruption (Document 9, page 28).
   - A terrestrial biological survey conducted by TRCA assessed existing flora and fauna to identify any potential impacts on natural habitats. The construction activities are planned to minimize the footprint and are scheduled outside of key migration and breeding windows to reduce habitat disruption (Document 18, page 26).

2. **Physical Impacts**:
   - The project will not involve riverine works, which helps limit potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems. There are also no known unique landforms in the area that would be affected (Document 10, page 23).
   - The project aims to provide long-term, low-maintenance protection against erosion, thus addressing the physical instability of slopes that can lead to property damage (Document 3, page 7).

### Social Impacts:
1. **Community Engagement**:
   - Public notifications and consultations have been initiated to inform community groups, local homeowners, and Indigenous communities about the project. The first point of contact was the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018 (Document 4, page 48).
   - There are considerations for public safety due to proximity to the slope and proposed safety features like fencing to mitigate risks to residents and visitors (Document 11, page 42).

2. **Accessibility and Infrastructure**:
   - The project acknowledges the presence of public footpaths and nearby infrastructure, planning access routes to minimize disruption during construction (Document 2, page 16).
   - There are no existing tourism operations within or adjacent to the project limits, thus reducing potential adverse impacts on recreational use (Document 6, page 37).

### Mitigation Measures:
The project proposes several measures to address these impacts:
- Implementing a comprehensive restoration plan post-construction to rehabilitate disturbed areas (Document 18, page 26).
- Scheduling construction activities to minimize disruption to local wildlife and vegetation.
- Engaging with the community throughout the project lifecycle to address concerns and provide updates.

In summary, the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" outlines a thorough approach to understanding and mitigating the environmental and social impacts of the slope stabilization project, ensuring a balance between development needs and ecological preservation.
