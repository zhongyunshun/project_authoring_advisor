The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is structured into three phases for its design and implementation, as outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II." Here's a brief overview of the planned phases:

1. **Phase I**: This phase focused on initial site setup and preliminary construction activities, including the establishment of staging areas and initial restoration efforts.

2. **Phase II**: The current phase, which includes the Western Headland, aims to complete major maintenance activities and further the restoration of the shoreline. Specific tasks include the construction of structures to protect the shoreline and ensure its stability.

3. **Phase III**: This phase is anticipated to involve additional restoration and enhancements along the shoreline, including measures to retain beach material and further habitat improvements.

Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring comprehensive maintenance and restoration of the park's shoreline. The project is managed by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and is designed to address erosion risks and enhance the ecological health of the area.
