The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project include regular inspections and maintenance activities. 

According to the retrieved documents, the site will undergo inspections during the first year after significant storm events and will be monitored annually thereafter. This approach is designed to ensure that the implemented erosion control measures are stable and performing as intended. Any required maintenance will be carried out based on the findings from these inspections. 

Specifically, the post-construction monitoring aims to assess the effectiveness of the erosion control structures and to address any deficiencies that may arise over time (Document 1, Document 2, Document 9, and Document 13). 

These strategies are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the shoreline and preventing further erosion, thus ensuring the long-term protection of the Humber Bay Park East area.
