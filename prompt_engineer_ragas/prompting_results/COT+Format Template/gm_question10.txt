To address your query regarding the contributions of tree removals and restoration plantings in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project to biodiversity and the mitigation of impacts on species at risk, including bats and butternut trees, we can refer to several relevant points from the retrieved documents.

1. **Tree Removals**: The project necessitates the removal of certain trees, including up to 180 trees identified for removal and 38 expected to be injured (Document 12). However, the tree removals will be planned to be minimal and highly selective, ensuring that the overall impact on vegetation communities is kept to a minimum (Document 16). This approach is crucial in managing the habitat of species at risk, such as the butternut, which is protected under Ontarioâ€™s Endangered Species Act (Document 1).

2. **Restoration Efforts**: Post-construction restoration activities are planned to focus on replanting suitable native species. This is intended to compensate for the trees that were removed and enhance local biodiversity (Document 8). The selection of native species for replanting is essential as it helps in stabilizing the soil, reducing erosion, and improving habitat for various wildlife, including bats. The restoration plan aims to create a more resilient ecosystem that supports diverse flora and fauna (Document 6).

3. **Protection of Species at Risk**: Specific measures are noted for the butternut trees found in the area. A Category 2 butternut tree has been identified within the project area (Document 2). Protecting these trees through selective management can support their recovery and mitigate the risk of further decline (Document 21). The project also specifies that construction activities will occur outside key breeding windows to minimize impacts on nesting birds (Document 14), which is part of a broader strategy to protect wildlife during the project.

4. **Biodiversity Monitoring**: The project emphasizes the importance of monitoring the ecological impacts, including the potential effects on wildlife populations and habitat connectivity (Document 7). The inclusion of a biological survey prior to the commencement of construction highlights the need to assess existing conditions and adjust plans accordingly to mitigate any adverse impacts on species at risk.

In summary, the structured approach to tree removals and restoration planting within the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project is designed to mitigate biodiversity loss by ensuring that the impacts on species at risk, such as butternut trees and bats, are minimized. The integration of restoration practices aims to enhance the ecological integrity of the area, fostering a more diverse and resilient habitat.
