The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several measures to ensure the protection and minimal disruption of local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory. Key strategies include:

1. **Baseline Inventory and Monitoring**: A comprehensive baseline inventory has been conducted to assess the existing conditions of the local aquatic habitats and species. This includes identifying common species found in the area, such as Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt, which are monitored through specific aquatic inventory methods (Documents 1, 3, 21).

2. **Minimized Disturbance**: The design of protective structures along the shoreline is intended to minimize cutting and disturbing native material, thereby protecting the existing aquatic habitat from potential contamination and alteration (Document 2). 

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Prior to construction, staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated using standard silt socks to prevent the entry of harmful substances into the watercourse. This is crucial for maintaining water quality and safeguarding aquatic species (Documents 8, 9, 12).

4. **Habitat Features Development**: Ongoing discussions regarding the development of aquatic habitat features involve collaboration between various stakeholders, including TRCA, DFO, and the City of Toronto. Proposed habitat components, such as surcharged revetments, are designed to enhance the aquatic environment (Document 7).

5. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After project completion, the site will undergo inspections, especially after significant storm events, to ensure stability and functionality of the implemented works. This ongoing monitoring is essential for assessing the health of aquatic habitats and making necessary adjustments (Document 22).

These measures collectively aim to protect the aquatic ecosystem within Humber Bay Park East, ensuring that maintenance activities do not adversely affect local wildlife. For further details, you may refer to the specific documents related to the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project.
