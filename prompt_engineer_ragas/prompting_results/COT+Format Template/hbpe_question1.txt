#### In the "Design Brief - Phase II" document, what specific engineering challenges and considerations were addressed during the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East? ####

The "Design Brief - Phase II" document outlines several engineering challenges and considerations encountered during the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East. Key points include:

1. **Coastal Conditions Evaluation**: The existing site conditions and coastal conditions along the shoreline were evaluated to inform the design. This includes assessing wave action, erosion patterns, and sediment movement (Document 4, Page 19).

2. **Erosion Control Measures**: The design incorporates erosion and sediment control measures to prevent the entry of harmful substances into the watercourse during construction. This includes isolating staging and stockpiling areas with silt socks (Document 8, Page 33).

3. **Habitat Preservation**: The design aims to minimize disturbance to native materials and existing habitats along the shoreline. Structures were designed to avoid excessive excavation, thereby protecting aquatic habitats and maintaining ecological integrity (Document 12, Page 22).

4. **Wave Overtopping Analysis**: The design considerations included estimating wave overtopping rates using methods for armored slopes and walls, which is critical for ensuring the stability and effectiveness of the shoreline protection structures (Document 16, Page 25).

5. **Material Selection and Structural Design**: The design process involved selecting appropriate materials (such as rubble and gravel) and ensuring that structures are robust enough to withstand environmental forces, including potential contamination of native materials (Document 15, Page 13; Document 18, Page 6).

These challenges are essential for ensuring that the shoreline protection measures are effective, sustainable, and environmentally responsible. The overall goal is to enhance the resilience of Humber Bay Park East against erosion while preserving its ecological value.
