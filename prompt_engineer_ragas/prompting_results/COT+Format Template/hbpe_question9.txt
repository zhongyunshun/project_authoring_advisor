In the planning and implementation phases of the projects, several engagements and consultations with local Indigenous communities are detailed in the TRCA documents. The following points summarize the key aspects of Indigenous engagement as captured in the retrieved documents:

1. **Engagement Purpose**: Indigenous Engagement is designed to provide Indigenous communities with information about project proposals and allow them to have input, ensuring that their views and experiences are considered. This engagement process varies depending on the community's interests and the project scope (Document 1).

2. **Consultation Process**: Prior to notifications, the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) was consulted to identify which Indigenous communities should be contacted during the engagement process. Additional contact lists were also utilized (Document 2, Document 10).

3. **Community Involvement**: Specific Indigenous communities, such as the Credit First Nation and the Williams Treaties First Nations, were engaged, and no adverse effects on traditional land uses were reported during these consultations (Document 3).

4. **Communication and Feedback**: The engagement process involved respecting the culture and practices of Indigenous communities, ensuring open dialogue and regular opportunities for feedback (Document 4). 

5. **Record of Consultation**: A comprehensive record of Indigenous community consultations, including correspondence, was maintained as part of the project documentation (Document 6).

6. **Summary of Engagements**: The documents include summaries of engagements, outlining communications with various Indigenous groups such as the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation and the Haudenosaunee, which demonstrate TRCAâ€™s commitment to developing positive relationships through meaningful engagement (Document 11, Document 15).

7. **Environmental Studies Consultation**: Indigenous communities expressed interest in ecological and aquatic studies related to the project, and they were provided with relevant information, showcasing the active participation of these communities in the planning phases (Document 19).

These engagements illustrate a structured and respectful approach to involving Indigenous communities throughout the project's lifecycle, ensuring that their perspectives are integrated into decision-making processes.
