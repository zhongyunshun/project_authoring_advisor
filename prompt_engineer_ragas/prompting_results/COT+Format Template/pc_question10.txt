The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity by emphasizing careful planning and management strategies for both bat species and butternut trees identified within the project area.

### Bat Species
The project recognizes the presence of bat habitat within the area, and appropriate compensation measures will be coordinated by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) staff in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol. This indicates a commitment to mitigate potential impacts on bat populations, ensuring that their habitats are considered during the project's execution (Document 8).

### Butternut Trees
The brief identifies a Category 2 butternut tree within the project area, which is protected under Ontario's Endangered Species Act due to its status as an endangered species. The project recognizes the tree's genetic purity and susceptibility to butternut canker, underlining the importance of safeguarding this species during construction activities. Additionally, the brief mentions that tree removals will be highly selective, aiming to minimize impacts on existing vegetation communities (Document 11 and Document 20).

### Summary of Conservation Measures
The document outlines that:
- **Construction Timing**: Works are scheduled to avoid the bird nesting window, which helps to protect avian species during critical times.
- **Minimization of Impact**: Tree removals will be planned and highly selective to ensure minimal disruption to biodiversity.
- **Restoration Activities**: Post-construction efforts will focus on replanting suitable native species to enhance overall biodiversity.

These strategies reflect an integrated approach to biodiversity conservation within the framework of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, aligning with TRCA's commitment to environmental stewardship.
