The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects like the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project include regular inspections and post-construction monitoring. Specifically, the site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter. This monitoring is crucial to ensure that the implemented works remain stable and perform as designed. Any necessary maintenance identified during these inspections will be undertaken to address any issues that arise (source: Document 1, Document 2).
