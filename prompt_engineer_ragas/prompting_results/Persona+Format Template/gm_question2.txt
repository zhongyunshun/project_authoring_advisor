The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several measures to protect local wildlife, particularly aquatic species, while minimizing disruption during construction. Key actions include:

1. **Aquatic Habitat Considerations**: The project has undertaken a baseline inventory that identified various aquatic species, including Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt, indicating a focus on maintaining and enhancing aquatic habitats (Document 1).

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control**: Prior to construction, erosion and sediment control measures will be implemented. These include isolating staging and stockpiling areas with silt socks to prevent harmful substances from entering the watercourse, thus protecting aquatic habitats (Documents 8 and 9).

3. **Monitoring Stations**: The project involves monitoring stations to observe fish populations and aquatic health. This ongoing monitoring will help assess the impact of construction activities on local aquatic species (Document 21).

4. **Design of Protection Structures**: The design of shoreline protection structures aims to minimize disruption to native materials, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of local ecosystems. This approach is intended to reduce habitat alteration and loss during construction (Document 2).

5. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After the completion of major construction activities, the site will undergo inspections, particularly after major storm events, to ensure that the implemented works are stable and continue to support local wildlife (Document 22).

These measures reflect a commitment to ecological preservation throughout the maintenance project, addressing potential impacts on local wildlife effectively.
