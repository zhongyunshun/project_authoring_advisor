To address potential social impacts related to access to parklands and community recreational spaces in areas like German Mills Settlers Park, the erosion hazard management strategies include several considerations:

1. **Public Safety**: Erosion management plans prioritize user safety by identifying and addressing erosion hazard sites that pose risks to park infrastructure and users. For instance, the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project outlines potential public health risks due to erosion, which necessitates safety features like fencing and clear signage to protect visitors (Document 1).

2. **Community Engagement**: The project brief mentions opportunities for community feedback, particularly regarding the enhancement of terrestrial and aquatic habitats while maintaining public enjoyment of the park (Document 3). This indicates that community input is considered in the planning and implementation phases.

3. **Long-term Access Solutions**: Proposed works aim to not only protect sanitary infrastructure but also to provide long-term solutions that ensure continued access to recreational areas. This includes the design of infrastructure that minimizes disruption to park users while effectively managing erosion (Document 18).

4. **Environmental and Social Assessments**: As part of the Municipal Class Environmental Assessment (MCEA), the project evaluates the potential impacts on both the physical environment and the community. This comprehensive assessment helps in planning measures that mitigate negative social impacts, ensuring that recreational spaces remain accessible and enjoyable (Document 17).

Overall, the management approach in German Mills Settlers Park reflects a commitment to balancing infrastructure protection with the need to maintain community access and recreational opportunities.
