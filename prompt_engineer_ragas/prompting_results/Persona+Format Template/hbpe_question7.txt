The "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief" outlines the selection of erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and gravel beaches, by considering their effectiveness in addressing erosion concerns and their environmental impact. 

1. **Effectiveness**: The design concepts were aimed at addressing critical issues like low crest elevation, wave overtopping, and overall structural stability. For instance, the use of armourstone was chosen due to its durability and ability to withstand wave action, which is crucial for protecting the shoreline. The headlands, particularly WF11.10 (Western Armourstone Headland) and WF11.12 (Eastern Armourstone Headland), are designed to minimize erosion and maintain structural integrity under challenging conditions, such as high water levels (Source: Document 5, 14).

2. **Environmental Impact**: The documents also emphasize minimizing disturbance to native materials while implementing these structures. For example, smaller cobbles were considered for beach treatments as they can create a more user-friendly environment but require careful consideration due to their potential for increased maintenance needs and environmental footprint (Source: Document 11). The placement of new material over existing structures where toe and slope stability permits indicates a strategy that aims to balance effective erosion control with minimal ecological disruption (Source: Document 5).

In summary, the selection of erosion control structures in the Humber Bay Park East project was a strategic decision based on their ability to effectively mitigate erosion while considering the environmental implications of their construction and maintenance.
