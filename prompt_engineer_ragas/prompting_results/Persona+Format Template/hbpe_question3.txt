The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation. Key practices include:

1. **Erosion Control Measures**: The project addresses significant erosion concerns through the installation of protective structures designed to enhance slope stability and minimize the likelihood of wave overtopping. By placing new materials over existing structures where feasible, the project reduces the need for extensive excavation, which can disturb the local ecosystem (Document 6).

2. **Native Material Protection**: The design of protection structures considers the potential contamination of native materials. This approach aims to minimize disruption to the existing habitat and preserve the natural shoreline environment (Document 17).

3. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After the implementation of maintenance works, the site will be monitored annually and following major storm events to ensure stability and performance. This ongoing assessment allows for timely interventions if erosion or other issues arise, thereby supporting long-term ecological health (Document 12).

4. **Restoration Plantings**: The project includes plans for ecological restoration, which will involve regrading and seeding. The comprehensive restoration plan will be developed during the detailed design phase and aims to enhance biodiversity and restore natural habitats post-construction (Document 22).

These practices reflect a commitment to sustainable management of the park's natural resources while also addressing immediate structural needs.
