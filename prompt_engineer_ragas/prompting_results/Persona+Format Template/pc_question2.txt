In light of the findings from the Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, several measures are proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife:

1. **Minimized Construction Footprint**: All construction activities are planned to have the smallest possible construction footprint. This approach aims to limit disturbances to existing habitats within the Project limits (Document 3, page 26).

2. **Timing of Construction Activities**: Construction activities are scheduled to occur outside of key migration and breeding windows. This timing is crucial to avoid impacts during periods when habitat use by wildlife is most critical (Document 3, page 26; Document 18, page 27).

3. **Selective Tree Removal**: The proposed works involve the removal of select canopy trees, which is expected to result in only minimal impacts to bird habitats. The construction activities will also be timed to avoid the bird breeding window to further protect avian species (Document 18, page 27).

4. **Restoration Plans**: A comprehensive restoration plan is included to rehabilitate and restore any disturbed areas post-construction. This plan will help re-establish habitats that may be temporarily affected by construction activities (Document 3, page 26).

5. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Ongoing monitoring and maintenance will be part of the project to ensure that any potential impacts on wildlife are addressed promptly (inferred from general practices in environmental assessments).

These measures collectively aim to protect local wildlife populations and preserve ecological integrity during the implementation of the erosion control and slope stabilization project.
