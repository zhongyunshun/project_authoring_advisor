To address the long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies recommended in the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" for ensuring the durability and effectiveness of the slope stabilization measures, the document specifies that periodic maintenance of vegetation will be essential during the first few years until the vegetation becomes well established. This is crucial as maintaining healthy vegetation can help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion.

Additionally, the project emphasizes the need for ongoing inspections of sediment control measures to ensure they are functioning correctly, thereby preventing any deleterious substances from entering the watercourse during and after construction (Document 3, page 15).

For comprehensive details on the scope of work and the overall design rationale, the document suggests referring to Section 5 â€“ Remediation Design in the Detailed Design Brief prepared by Terraprobe (Document 6, page 13).

These strategies are part of a broader framework to mitigate risks to life and property from slope erosion, aligned with the project's objectives under the Class Environmental Assessment for Remedial Flood and Erosion Control Projects (Document 8, page 3).
