The restoration plantings described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" contribute to mitigating biodiversity loss by focusing on the replanting of suitable native species that enhance local ecosystems. Specifically, it incorporates a commitment to plant a certain number of trees, which serves to replace those removed during construction and to improve overall biodiversity in the area. For example, during the restoration process, 280 trees are planned for planting as part of the preliminary planting plans (Document 3, page 35).

Moreover, the restoration strategies aim to remove exotic species and replace them with native flora, which is essential for supporting local wildlife and creating a more resilient ecosystem. This approach not only facilitates habitat recovery but also directly benefits species at risk by improving their habitat quality and availability (Document 4, page 27). The overall goal of these restoration activities is to enhance naturalization in the project area, thereby contributing positively to biodiversity conservation and ecological health (Document 10, page 44).

In summary, the restoration efforts are designed to address biodiversity loss by re-establishing native plant communities, which in turn supports various species—particularly those that are at risk—by providing essential habitat and resources.
