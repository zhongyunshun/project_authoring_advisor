The shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" have several implications for local wildlife, particularly aquatic species. The baseline inventory section identifies various species, including Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt, which were found during monitoring activities at three stations.

1. **Aquatic Habitat Alteration**: The project involves construction activities that may alter existing aquatic habitats. Notably, the design includes protection structures that minimize the disturbance of native materials, which is crucial since the native material composition of the shoreline may be contaminated (Document 3, page 22). These constructions are aimed at protecting the shoreline while considering the potential impacts on fish habitats.

2. **Monitoring and Mitigation**: The project recognizes the need for ongoing monitoring of aquatic habitats during and after construction to assess the impact on fish species. This includes evaluating the areas of aquatic habitat that may be altered or lost (Document 13, page 25). Furthermore, specific mitigation measures are in place to minimize disturbances during the construction phase.

3. **Native and Invasive Species Management**: The project acknowledges the presence of both native and invasive species, such as the Round Goby, which is classified as invasive. Efforts to manage these species during construction and restoration activities are essential to maintaining the ecological balance in the area (Document 14, page 18).

4. **Restoration Efforts**: Following the completion of construction, restoration plantings are planned to compensate for any impacts on local wildlife. This includes the introduction of native plant species to support the overall ecosystem (Document 20, page 36).

In summary, the shoreline maintenance project is designed with considerations for local aquatic species, aiming to mitigate negative impacts while enhancing habitat conditions through careful planning, monitoring, and restoration efforts.
