The anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project are outlined in the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP." Hereâ€™s a summary of these impacts and the proposed mitigation strategies:

### Anticipated Environmental Impacts:
1. **Wildlife Habitat**: The project area does not have significant wildlife populations, which indicates minimal anticipated impacts on local fauna (Document 9, page 28).
2. **Vegetation Communities**: The project aims to minimize impacts on existing vegetation and soil removal, and it includes a comprehensive restoration plan to address any disturbance (Document 18, page 26).
3. **Water Quality and Drainage**: Proposed works are designed to address drainage and stormwater runoff concerns, thereby aiming to protect water quality within the project limits (Document 8, page 44).
4. **Ecosystem Stability**: The project's design considers the surrounding urban land use and its influence on erosion and slope stability, with strategies tailored to mitigate risks (Document 19, page 38).

### Anticipated Social Impacts:
1. **Public Safety**: The project will require safety features such as fences along trails and slopes to mitigate potential risks to the public (Document 11, page 42).
2. **Property Accessibility**: The project includes proposed access routes to ensure that the properties affected by the erosion control works can be accessed effectively (Document 6, page 37).
3. **Community Engagement**: The first point of public contact occurred with a Notice of Intent published on November 22, 2018, and notifications were sent to local community groups and Indigenous communities to ensure stakeholder engagement (Document 4, page 48).

### Proposed Mitigation Strategies:
- **Construction Footprint Minimization**: All construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible and are scheduled outside key migration and breeding windows to further reduce impacts on local habitats (Document 18, page 26).
- **Public Consultation**: The project includes a public consultation process to keep the community informed and address concerns, thereby promoting transparency and engagement (Document 4, page 48).
- **Long-term Monitoring**: The project plan emphasizes the importance of ongoing monitoring to ensure that the objectives of risk mitigation and environmental protection are met efficiently (Document 5, page 3).

In conclusion, the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project has been designed to address anticipated environmental and social impacts while promoting community engagement and ensuring safety through careful planning and mitigation strategies.
