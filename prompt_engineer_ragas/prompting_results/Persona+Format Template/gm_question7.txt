The decision-making process behind choosing specific erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches, involves several factors, including effectiveness in preventing erosion, environmental impact, cost considerations, and user experience.

1. **Effectiveness**: Armourstone headlands are typically selected for their ability to stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. For instance, the new revetment structures planned for the Humber Bay Park area are designed to stabilize and prevent further erosion along key sections of the shoreline (source: Design Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 20). The effectiveness of these structures is often evaluated using models to assess their performance under various wave conditions.

2. **Environmental Impact**: Environmental considerations play a crucial role in the selection of erosion control structures. Smaller cobble sizes may create a more user-friendly beach environment, but they require more material to be effective, leading to higher costs and potential maintenance challenges (source: Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 20). Additionally, the TRCA has monitored the impact of existing structures on local ecosystems through its Erosion Risk Management Program (source: Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 3).

3. **Cost Considerations**: The decision often weighs the initial construction costs against long-term maintenance needs. For example, while smaller cobble treatments may be more appealing for recreational use, they have higher installation and maintenance costs due to their larger volume requirements (source: Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 20).

4. **User Experience**: The usability of the shoreline for park visitors is also a significant consideration. The design choices reflect a balance between effective erosion control and creating accessible, enjoyable spaces for the community (source: Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 20).

Overall, the TRCA's approach to selecting erosion control structures is based on a comprehensive analysis of these factors, aiming to create solutions that are not only effective but also sustainable and beneficial for the community.
