The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is structured into three distinct phases for its design and implementation. As outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II," the future phases include:

1. **Phase I**: This phase has already been initiated and includes preliminary restoration efforts.
   
2. **Phase II**: Currently ongoing, this phase focuses on the Western Headland and includes significant maintenance works to enhance the shoreline's resilience and usability.

3. **Phase III**: Planned for the future, this phase will involve further enhancements, including the placement of beach material and additional restoration activities. The document mentions that some preliminary restoration work will occur along the Eastern Headland following the completion of Phase II, which will set the stage for Phase III.

This phased approach allows for careful management of resources and ensures ongoing improvements to the park while monitoring the impacts of each phase on the environment and user experience (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase II).
