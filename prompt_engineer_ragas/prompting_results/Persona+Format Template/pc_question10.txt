The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity through various measures aimed at protecting both bat species and butternut trees identified in the project area.

1. **Bat Species**: The project recognizes the presence of bat habitat within the area and includes a commitment to coordinate appropriate compensation for any impacts to bat species, following the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol. This suggests a proactive approach to ensure that bat populations are not adversely affected by construction activities (Document 8).

2. **Butternut Trees**: The project area includes a Category 2 butternut tree, which is affected by butternut canker but not to an advanced degree. As butternuts are classified as an endangered species under Ontarioâ€™s Endangered Species Act, the project takes special care to monitor and manage the impacts on these trees. The genetic testing of the butternut tree indicated that it is genetically pure, which is crucial for its preservation (Documents 1 and 2). The project plans to conduct selective tree removals and to focus on minimal impacts during construction, ensuring that any necessary tree removals are done with consideration to the health of the remaining vegetation (Document 21).

3. **Construction Practices**: The project emphasizes selective removal of trees and shrubs, which aims to minimize overall impact on vegetation communities within the area. Moreover, construction activities are scheduled to occur outside critical periods for wildlife, such as the bird breeding window, further reducing potential disturbances to local biodiversity (Documents 6 and 20).

In summary, the project brief outlines a comprehensive strategy to mitigate impacts on biodiversity, specifically focusing on the conservation of bat species and butternut trees through careful planning and adherence to environmental protection protocols.
