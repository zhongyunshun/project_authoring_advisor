To accurately respond to your query, the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" document does not explicitly detail the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the Class Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project. However, it does outline various public consultations and notifications which imply stakeholder involvement.

Key points regarding stakeholder engagement include:

1. **Public Notifications and Consultation**: The process began with the publication of a Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018, indicating that stakeholders, including community groups and homeowners in the vicinity, were notified and involved in the consultation process (Document 3).

2. **Decision-Making Process**: The project was developed in accordance with the Class EA process, which emphasizes the importance of engaging with stakeholders throughout the planning and decision-making phases (Document 2).

3. **Community Involvement**: Stakeholders, including Indigenous communities and local residents, were included in the communication and consultation efforts to address concerns regarding the project (Document 3).
