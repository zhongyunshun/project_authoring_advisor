The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project has considered potential social impacts and community safety through various measures outlined in its project plans. Here are the key points:

1. **Public Safety Considerations**: The project has assessed potential risks to public safety, particularly along trails and slopes, and identified the need for safety features like fences to mitigate these risks. It rates the impact on public safety as "Low to Moderate," indicating that while there are some concerns, they are manageable (Document 3).

2. **Public Consultation**: The project has engaged in public notifications and consultation, beginning with a Notice of Intent published on November 22, 2018. This process involved outreach to community groups, local homeowners, and Indigenous communities to ensure that the concerns and interests of the local population are addressed (Document 18).

3. **Access and Traffic Management**: The construction will temporarily restrict pedestrian traffic on an active paved pedestrian pathway that runs through the parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent. This is a necessary measure to facilitate construction while ensuring that the community is informed and safe during the process (Document 9).

4. **Impact Mitigation Strategies**: The project includes measures aimed at minimizing impacts on existing vegetation and addressing drainage and stormwater runoff concerns, which can affect the surrounding community (Document 4). This holistic approach aims to preserve local environmental quality while stabilizing the slope.

5. **Evaluation of Existing Conditions**: The project acknowledges that there are no existing tourism operations within the project limits, which means there are fewer social impacts in terms of disruption to local businesses (Document 7). 

Overall, the project's design and implementation plan is structured to prioritize community safety and engagement while addressing the environmental challenges posed by slope instability.
