The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" outlines several long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the erosion control measures that have been installed. These strategies include:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and annually thereafter to ensure that the implemented works are stable and performing as designed. Any maintenance required will be addressed as needed (Document 1, Page 36).

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Prior to the start of construction, standard erosion and sediment control (ESC) measures will be implemented and maintained during the construction phases to prevent sediment from entering the water. Damaged ESC measures should be repaired or replaced within 48 hours of inspection (Document 5, Page 4).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: There will be ongoing monitoring to ensure all best management practices are being used to avoid or minimize disturbance to the environment. Regular checks will be conducted, and any damaged or defective ESC measures will be repaired promptly (Document 15, Page 45).

4. **Site Restoration and Vegetation Monitoring**: For the restoration, areas will be regraded and seeded, and monitoring of proposed vegetation will be conducted for two years after planting to ensure its survivability (Document 7, Page 5).

These strategies aim to ensure the longevity and effectiveness of the erosion control measures while minimizing ecological impacts and promoting environmental stability.
