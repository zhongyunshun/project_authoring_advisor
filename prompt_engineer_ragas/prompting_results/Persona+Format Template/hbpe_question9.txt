Yes, there are specific engagements and consultations with local Indigenous communities detailed in the planning and implementation phases of TRCA projects. For instance, prior to notifications being sent out, the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) provided advice on which Indigenous communities should be contacted during the Indigenous Engagement process. The communities involved included the Credit First Nation, Williams Treaties First Nations, and the Huron-Wendat Nation, among others.

During the engagement, TRCA emphasized the importance of respecting the culture and practices of Indigenous communities and ensuring meaningful dialogue and feedback opportunities. Consultations included providing information about archaeological assessments and environmental studies, with copies of relevant documents shared with interested nations. Additionally, a comprehensive record of Indigenous community consultation was maintained, which includes all correspondence and feedback received during the engagement process.

For example, in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, there was no adverse effect on traditional land uses identified during engagement, and the project's planning process involved active participation and communication with Indigenous communities (source: 2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, pages 28, 49, 50; German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, pages 292, 293, 575).
