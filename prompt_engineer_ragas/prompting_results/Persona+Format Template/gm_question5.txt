The erosion control and slope stabilization efforts for both the Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent projects are indeed planned in phases.

For the **Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project**, the project has been divided into three phases for design and implementation. This multi-year construction approach allows for a comprehensive response to erosion concerns noted in the area, particularly following significant weather events that impacted the shoreline (source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I, page 4).

Regarding the **Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project**, the documentation suggests that the project is also structured to assess potential effects and impacts in phases. While specific future phases were not detailed in the retrieved passages, it implies ongoing evaluation and potential expansions depending on the success of initial implementations and any emerging needs (source: Class EA Project Plan: Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, page 46).
