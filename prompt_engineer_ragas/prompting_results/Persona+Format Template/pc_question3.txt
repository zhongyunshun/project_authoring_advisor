The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" outlines several strategies aimed at promoting sustainable development and conservation throughout the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project. Here are some key points:

1. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: The project emphasizes the isolation of the work area using standard sediment control fencing to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse. This is crucial for maintaining water quality and protecting aquatic habitats during construction (Document 12, page 15).

2. **Minimizing Construction Footprint**: All construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible. This approach aims to mitigate impacts on existing natural habitats and minimize disturbance to the surrounding environment (Document 8, page 26).

3. **Timing of Activities**: Construction activities are scheduled to occur outside of key migration and breeding windows, which helps protect local wildlife during critical periods of their life cycles (Document 8, page 26).

4. **Restoration Plans**: A comprehensive restoration plan is included in the project, which aims to rehabilitate disturbed areas post-construction, further promoting environmental sustainability (Document 8, page 26).

5. **Utility Locates and Infrastructure Considerations**: The project takes into account existing utilities and the surrounding infrastructure, ensuring that any disturbance is minimized and that existing systems are respected (Document 21, page 12).

These strategies reflect a commitment to sustainable practices within the scope of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, aligning with the TRCA's goals of environmental stewardship and community safety.
