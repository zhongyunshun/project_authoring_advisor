Based on the "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final," the key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives included:

1. **Factor of Safety (FOS)**: The alternatives were developed based on a requested Factor of Safety of 1.3, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the stabilization methods.

2. **Feasibility and Constructability**: The evaluation process considered how practical each alternative was in terms of construction and implementation.

3. **Cost**: The financial implications of each stabilization method were critically assessed, influencing the decision-making process.

4. **Environmental Impact**: The potential effects of each alternative on the existing environment, including vegetation and drainage, were taken into account.

5. **Performance**: The effectiveness of the alternatives in addressing erosion and slope stability issues was a major consideration.

These factors collectively guided the selection of the preferred alternative for slope stabilization at the specified locations on Peacham Crescent.
