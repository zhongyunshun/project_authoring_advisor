In the development and implementation of TRCA (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority) projects, local Indigenous communities are consulted and involved through various engagement strategies. 

1. **Formal and Informal Partnerships**: The TRCA aims to create positive relationships with Indigenous communities, which can take the form of both informal partnerships in various initiatives and formal engagement for projects that require adherence to legislation mandating such involvement. This includes communities like the Haudenosaunee and Métis.

2. **Indigenous Engagement Processes**: The TRCA acknowledges that Indigenous communities have diverse views and experiences that can contribute significantly to projects. Accordingly, Indigenous engagement may vary between communities and depends on the specific scope of the project as well as the interests of the communities involved.

3. **Public Notifications and Consultation**: Consultation with Indigenous communities is part of the public consultation process mandated by the Class Environmental Assessment (EA). For example, the Peacham Crescent project involved notifying Indigenous groups of project intentions and inviting their input.

4. **Documentation of Consultation**: A record of Indigenous community consultations, including all correspondence, is maintained for transparency and accountability. For instance, the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project includes a detailed record of the Indigenous engagement process in its documentation.

5. **Consulting on Planning Matters**: The TRCA recognizes the importance of consulting with Aboriginal communities regarding planning matters that may affect their rights and interests. TRCA’s jurisdiction encompasses many traditional territories and Treaty areas, underlining the necessity of such consultations.

Overall, the TRCA employs a comprehensive approach to ensure that local Indigenous communities are actively involved in the planning, development, and implementation phases of projects like those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay.
