The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project includes several measures to protect local wildlife and minimize disruption to aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory. Key actions noted in the documentation include:

1. **Baseline Inventory**: Extensive baseline data has been collected regarding local aquatic species and habitats to guide the design and implementation of project activities (as noted in Document 3).

2. **Wetland and Aquatic Habitat Considerations**: The project will address potential habitat alterations and losses. Monitoring stations have been established to track aquatic conditions and habitat health, ensuring any necessary adjustments can be made in real-time (mentioned in several documents, including Document 5 and Document 4).

3. **Consultation with Relevant Authorities**: There is ongoing dialogue between the Toronto Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), and other stakeholders to develop aquatic habitat components and management plans collaboratively. This collaborative approach aims to ensure that all regulatory requirements concerning aquatic life are met (as seen in Document 7).

4. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: The project includes specific erosion and sediment control measures to prevent sedimentation in water bodies, which can harm aquatic organisms. Effective measures such as using silt socks to isolate staging and stockpiling areas will be implemented prior to construction activities to protect aquatic habitats (noted in Documents 8 and 9).

5. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After construction activities, the site will undergo inspections to monitor conditions specific to wildlife, especially following significant weather events. This ongoing assessment will help ensure that the local ecosystem remains healthy and resilient (as mentioned in Document 22).

Overall, the emphasis on monitoring, controlling construction impacts, and ongoing consultation with stakeholders contributes to the project's strategy for safeguarding the aquatic species within the Humber Bay Park East area.
