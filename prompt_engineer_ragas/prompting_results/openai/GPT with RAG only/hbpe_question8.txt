The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects such as the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" include:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter to ensure the effectiveness of the erosion control measures.

2. **Regular Monitoring**: Trained professionals will conduct regular monitoring during construction to ensure all best management practices are being followed to minimize disturbance to the environment.

3. **Implementation of Updated Measures**: The erosion and sediment control strategies may need to be upgraded or amended based on changing site conditions to effectively minimize sediment-laden runoff.

4. **Visual Records**: Pre-construction and post-construction erosion monitoring should include a record of photographs to document conditions and any necessary actions taken.

These strategies aim to ensure that the erosion control measures remain effective and adapt to any changes that occur in the environment over time.
