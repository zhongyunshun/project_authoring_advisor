The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity with specific considerations for bat species and butternut trees within the project area.

1. **Bat Species**: The project brief mentions that bat habitat is present within the project area. To mitigate potential impacts on bats, appropriate compensation measures will be coordinated. This shows a proactive approach to ensure that the presence of bat species does not lead to significant disruptions during the project's implementation.

2. **Butternut Trees**: The project brief identifies the presence of a Category 2 butternut tree within the project area, which is significant since butternuts are classified as an endangered species and are protected under Ontario's Endangered Species Act. The brief includes a reference to further information related to the tree inventory, proposed removals, and injuries, suggesting that there is a structured plan in place to handle any interactions with this species. The report emphasizes that tree removals will be minimal and selective, aimed at preserving the overall welfare of the vegetation communities, which includes butternut trees.

Overall, the project brief reflects an integrated approach to biodiversity conservation by recognizing species of concern and planning construction activities to minimize impacts on these species.
