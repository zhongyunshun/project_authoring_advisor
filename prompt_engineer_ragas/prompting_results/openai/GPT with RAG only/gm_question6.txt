The erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park addresses potential social impacts, such as access to parklands and community recreational spaces, through several planned measures. 

1. **Infrastructure Protection**: The primary goal of the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project is to safeguard public sanitation infrastructure that is at risk due to stream bank erosion. This protection is crucial to ensure that facilities remain accessible to the community.

2. **Public Safety Considerations**: The project recognizes the potential risks to trail and park users, including public safety issues arising from erosion. As mentioned in the documents, safety features such as safety fences may be implemented to mitigate these risks and maintain safe access to recreational spaces.

3. **Habitat Enhancement**: The project includes secondary objectives focused on enhancing the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic habitats, which can improve the recreational value of the park. By preserving and enhancing these natural features, the park becomes more attractive and usable for community recreation.

4. **Community Engagement**: There is an emphasis on engaging with the community to inform them about the project and its benefits. Such involvement can address concerns that residents may have regarding access to parklands during and after the implementation of erosion control measures.

5. **Long-term Planning**: The project aims to provide long-term solutions for the protection of regional infrastructure while considering the impacts on community recreational spaces. This includes evaluating design alternatives that prioritize both infrastructure protection and the accessibility of park areas.

Overall, the management plan seeks a balance between safeguarding vital infrastructure and ensuring that community members continue to enjoy the parklands and recreational opportunities available to them.
