The engagement of Indigenous communities in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project is documented in the "Record of Indigenous Engagement" found in Appendix D of the Project Plan. The records include comprehensive documentation of consultations and copies of all correspondence related to the engagement process.

The project involved several Indigenous communities, including:
- Beausoleil First Nation
- Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation
- Chippewas of Rama-Mnjikaning First Nation
- Huron-Wendat Nation

The consultations aimed to address public concerns and ensure that the perspectives of Indigenous communities were considered in the project's development. The outcomes of this engagement typically involve assessing Indigenous community feedback, which informs project planning and helps identify any potential impacts on Indigenous rights and interests. Although specific outcomes from the engagement process were not detailed in the retrieved passage, the involvement of Indigenous groups indicates a commitment to inclusivity and respect for Indigenous perspectives in the project's planning and execution. 

The extensive documentation surrounding public concerns and the formal process of consultation suggests that the engagement was a key component of ensuring transparency and addressing community interests in the project.
