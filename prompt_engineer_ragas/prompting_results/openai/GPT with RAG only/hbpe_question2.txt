The shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" have several implications for local wildlife, particularly aquatic species. Here are the key points regarding the potential impacts based on the baseline inventory section and other relevant contents found in the project brief:

1. **Aquatic Habitat Alteration**: The project includes aspects that may alter aquatic habitats, as highlighted in the baseline inventory. This alteration can result from construction activities that affect the physical and biological characteristics of the shoreline, potentially impacting species survival and reproduction.

2. **Monitoring and Mitigation Measures**: The project brief suggests that monitoring measures will be implemented to track the effects on aquatic species. TRCA staff are expected to follow specific mitigation measures during the construction phase to minimize adverse impacts on the aquatic environment. 

3. **Presence of Invasive Species**: The inventory includes mention of invasive species such as the Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) which could compete with native species for resources, potentially leading to declines in native populations due to the ongoing changes in habitat dynamics caused by maintenance activities.

4. **Baseline Data Importance**: A thorough baseline inventory has been conducted to support conceptual design development, indicating the project's approaches are data-driven. This data is essential for understanding current conditions and determining the potential impacts of maintenance activities on aquatic life.

5. **Restoration Plantings**: The brief outlines a plan for restoration plantings which indicates a proactive approach to mitigate any negative impacts from construction activities. These plantings can help restore habitats that may be affected and provide the necessary environments for local aquatic species.

6. **No In-Water Work**: Importantly, the project does not include in-water work, which limits the direct disturbance to aquatic habitats during construction. This aspect might be beneficial in protecting local aquatic species from immediate impacts during the maintenance phases.

In summary, while there are potential concerns regarding habitat alteration and the introduction of invasive species, the project includes measures for monitoring and mitigation, which could help manage and minimize negative impacts on local wildlife, especially the aquatic species referenced in the baseline inventory.
