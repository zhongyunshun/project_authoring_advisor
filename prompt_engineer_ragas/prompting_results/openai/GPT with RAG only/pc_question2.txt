Based on the findings from the Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, specific measures proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, particularly concerning identified species in the vicinity, include:

1. **Minimizing Habitat Disturbance**: The project plans to limit construction activities to minimize impact on existing habitat. This includes conducting work in a manner that reduces disruption to vegetation and wildlife.

2. **Selective Tree Removal**: The removal of trees will be minimal and highly selective. This approach is intended to ensure that the overall health and welfare of vegetation communities within the project area are preserved, ultimately supporting local wildlife habitats.

3. **Timing of Construction Activities**: Construction activities will be scheduled to occur outside of critical wildlife breeding periods, particularly for bird species. This timing aims to avoid disruption to nesting activities and minimize impacts on breeding populations.

4. **Public Consultation and Notifications**: Engaging with the public and stakeholders to inform them about the impacts and mitigation strategies. This can help gather additional insights and foster community support for wildlife protection measures.

5. **Monitoring and Adjustments**: Continuous monitoring of wildlife populations and habitats throughout the project timeline. If significant impacts are observed, adjustment measures can be implemented as necessary to safeguard local wildlife.

These measures reflect a commitment to environmental stewardship and the protection of local biodiversity within the project area.
