The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project emphasizes several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation. Here are some key aspects:

1. **Erosion Control**: The project addresses leading erosion concerns, particularly focusing on low crest elevation and wave overtopping. This is crucial for protecting the shoreline and maintaining the integrity of the park's ecosystems.

2. **Phased Implementation**: The project is divided into three phases for design and implementation. This allows for careful planning and monitoring of the environmental impact throughout the construction process, enabling adjustments as needed based on observed outcomes.

3. **Site Restoration Plans**: For example, Phase I includes site restoration efforts, which will involve regrading and seeding to promote natural plant growth and stabilize the soil, assisting in erosion control and improving habitat for wildlife.

4. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: The project includes plans for ongoing inspections after major storm events and annual assessments. This monitoring is intended to ensure that any constructed features are functioning as designed and to allow for remedial actions if needed.

5. **Native Vegetation**: The consideration of using native materials and plant species in restoration efforts is aimed at minimizing ecological disruption and fostering resilience in the local ecosystem.

6. **Climate Change Considerations**: The design incorporates research on climate change and its anticipated effects. This proactive approach aims to enhance the resilience of the park against future climate-related impacts.

7. **Holistic Design Approach**: The project design takes into account not just the immediate technical requirements but also the broader ecological and community implications, promoting a balance between human use and environmental health.

In summary, the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project is focused on implementing sustainable practices that prioritize environmental conservation through careful planning, monitoring, and ecological restoration efforts.
