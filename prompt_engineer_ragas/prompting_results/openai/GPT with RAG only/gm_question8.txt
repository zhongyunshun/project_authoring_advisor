The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects like the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project include:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter. This is to ensure the continued effectiveness of the erosion control measures and to identify any necessary maintenance actions.

2. **Site Restoration**: Restoration activities following construction may include limited regrading and seeding to promote vegetation growth, which can help stabilize the soil and control erosion.

3. **Inspection of Erosion Control Structures**: Regular evaluations of existing erosion control structures will occur to assess their condition and detect any deficiencies that might affect their performance.

These strategies are designed to maintain the integrity of the erosion control systems over time, ensuring they provide long-term protection of the shoreline.
