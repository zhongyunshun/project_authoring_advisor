The slope stabilization project on Peacham Crescent aims to address potential social impacts and ensure the safety of the local community through several key measures outlined in the Class Environmental Assessment (EA) Project Plan. Here are some highlights:

1. **Risk Mitigation**: The project identifies the risk of slope failure behind residential properties (specifically at 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent) and aims to implement stabilization techniques to mitigate these risks, thereby enhancing the safety of residents. 

2. **Public Notifications and Consultation**: The project follows the Class EA process, which includes public consultations and notifications. This involves engaging with the community to inform them about the project and gather input, which helps in addressing community concerns and potential social impacts.

3. **Ecological Considerations**: The project plan emphasizes the need to minimize impacts on existing vegetation and the surrounding ecosystem, which is vital for maintaining community aesthetics and environmental health. By addressing drainage and managing stormwater runoff, the project aims to prevent further erosion and protect local flora and fauna.

4. **Assessment of Impacts**: The project includes a thorough assessment of potential environmental impacts, including biological and historical assessments. As indicated in the plan, there are no significant wildlife populations or tourism operations within the project limits, which contributes to reducing social impacts on local recreational and community activities.

5. **Estimated Costs and Maintenance**: The project outlines the rough order of magnitude (ROM) costs for maintenance of the proposed structures, indicating a commitment to ensuring long-term safety and structural integrity, thereby enhancing community confidence in the project's effectiveness.

By focusing on risk mitigation, engaging with the community, and considering ecological factors, the project aims to effectively address potential social impacts and ensure the safety of the local community.
