Yes, the documents detail specific engagements and consultations with local Indigenous communities during the planning and implementation phases of the projects. Here are some key points from the extracted passages:

2. **Formal Record of Consultation**: A full record of Indigenous community consultation, including correspondence, is maintained in the Record of Indigenous Engagement specific to the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project (Document 6).

3. **Engagement with Specific Nations**: Various Indigenous communities were engaged, including the Credit First Nation, Williams Treaties First Nations, and the Huron-Wendat Nation. It was noted that there were no adverse effects identified on traditional land uses during these engagements (Document 3).

4. **Commitment to Respect Culture**: The documents emphasize the importance of respecting the culture and practices of Indigenous communities during engagement, incorporating open dialogue and feedback opportunities throughout the project (Document 4).

5. **Summary of Engagement and Archaeological Assessments**: Indigenous Nations were informed about completed archaeological assessments, and copies were provided to those nations that expressed interest (Document 8).

6. **Notification of Intent**: Notifications were issued to Indigenous communities, including engagement protocols (Document 16).

7. **Interest in Environmental Studies**: Certain Indigenous communities expressed interest in ecological and aquatic studies related to the project, and relevant information was shared with them (Documents 19).
