The "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA Project Plan" outlines several anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project and proposes measures to address these impacts:

1. **Environmental Impacts**:
   - **Wildlife and Habitat**: The plan indicates that there are no significant wildlife populations or riparian uses identified within the project limits, implying minimal anticipated impacts on local wildlife and natural habitats. Construction activities are planned to minimize impacts on existing natural habitats through careful planning and execution (Document 18).
   - **Vegetation and Soil**: The project is designed to have less impact on existing vegetation and to generate less soil removal compared to alternative methods, thereby promoting ecosystem conservation (Document 8).
   - **Erosion Control**: The project aims to address erosion hazards and slope instability, which could pose risks to human life and property. It will provide long-term, low-maintenance protection against these environmental issues (Document 3).

2. **Social Impacts**:
   - **Public Consultation**: The plan includes provisions for public notifications and consultations, acknowledging the importance of community engagement during the project implementation (Document 4).
   - **Impact on Property**: The plan considers the relationship of slope stabilization efforts to existing properties at the top of the slope. This aims to ensure that the structures are permanent and essential, thereby safeguarding human life and property (Document 2).

3. **Mitigation Measures**:
   - **Design Alternatives**: The project explores different design alternatives to minimize environmental disturbances, such as focusing stabilization efforts on the upper valley slope without involving riverine works (Document 16).
   - **Environmental Assessments**: A comprehensive assessment of potential effects is conducted, and screening criteria are evaluated to identify and address any adverse effects before project execution (Document 12 and 7).

The overall approach reflects a commitment to balance developmental needs with environmental stewardship and community interests.
