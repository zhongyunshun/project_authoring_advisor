The "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief" outlines the evaluation and selection of erosion control structures based on their effectiveness and environmental impact through a detailed assessment of various shoreline elements. Here are key points on how different structures were chosen:

1. **Structural Stability Assessment**: The brief details the overall condition and structural stability of erosion control structures such as armourstone headlands and gravel beaches. For instance, structures like the Western Armourstone Headland (WF11.10) were noted as 'Failing' with 'Fair' overall condition due to minor displacement of armour stones, which indicates that their current effectiveness may require reconsideration or enhancement.

2. **Erosion and Flooding Concerns**: The chosen designs aim to address existing erosion issues, such as backshore erosion and low crest elevations, which contribute to flooding risk. The brief emphasizes that these factors were critical in the selection of materials and the design of new structures, including additional stone placement to mitigate risks during high lake levels.

3. **Environmental Compatibility**: Decisions regarding the use of different materials, like smaller cobble sizes for beach areas, were made to ensure a user-friendly environment that would also blend aesthetically with the park's natural features. The impact on local ecosystems was also taken into account to minimize disruption while implementing effective coastal defenses.

4. **Concept Designs**: The brief includes various proposed concepts, such as the creation of berms with large armourstone or gravel beaches to enhance protection against wave overtopping. These ideas were designed to balance effective erosion control with maintaining the park's natural environment, thus indicating a thoughtful consideration of ecological impacts alongside engineering needs.

5. **Comparison of Alternatives**: The report discusses multiple options for beach design and shoreline protection (e.g., alternative fill placements over the existing profile), suggesting an evaluative process where potential environmental consequences were weighed against performance in controlling erosion.

Overall, the selection of erosion control structures in the Humber Bay Park East concept was guided by a combination of structural assessments, performance under various conditions, environmental impact considerations, and user accessibility, ensuring that both immediate and long-term issues were addressed effectively.
