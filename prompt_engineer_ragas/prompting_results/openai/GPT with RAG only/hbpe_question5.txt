The future phases planned for Humber Bay Park East, as mentioned in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II," include:

1. **Phase II â€“ Western Headland**: This phase consists of the specific works to be carried out at the western headland of the park.
2. **Phase III**: Although specific details about Phase III are not provided in the extracted passages, it is mentioned in relation to the beach material that will be placed east of a structure as part of this phase.

The project is structured into three phases for design and implementation due to the extent of the project area and the multi-year nature of the construction.
