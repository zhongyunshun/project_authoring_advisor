The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project has been designed with an emphasis on addressing potential social impacts and ensuring the safety of the local community. Here are some key elements based on the TRCA's technical documents:

1. **Risk Mitigation**: The project aims to mitigate risks associated with slope instability that could potentially endanger nearby residences. Specifically, there are significant concerns regarding slope failure behind properties located at 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent, which has prompted the need for this stabilization effort. By reinforcing the slope, the project seeks to protect these homes and ensure the safety of the residents (TRCA, 2019, Page 11).

2. **Public Consultation**: In accordance with the Class EA (Environmental Assessment) process, the project emphasizes public notifications and consultations. This involves engaging with local community members to ensure that their concerns and perspectives are heard and addressed, which is crucial for minimizing social impacts (TRCA, 2019, Page 48).

3. **Prevention of Deliterious Effects**: The implementation of sediment control measures prior to construction will help prevent any negative impacts on local water bodies that could arise from construction activities. These measures are crucial in maintaining the environmental health of the surrounding area, indirectly supporting community well-being (TRCA, 2021, Page 15).

4. **No Impact on Existing Tourism Operations**: The project findings indicate that there are no existing tourism operations within or adjacent to the project limits, which means there will be no adverse impacts on local tourism, thus being a positive aspect for community engagement (TRCA, 2019, Page 37).

Overall, the project addresses social impacts and community safety through risk mitigation strategies, public engagement, and environmental protection measures. If you need more detailed information or specific aspects addressed, feel free to ask!
