The decision-making process behind choosing specific erosion control structures like armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches involves several key factors, including effectiveness in preventing erosion, environmental impact, and user safety.

1. **Effectiveness in Preventing Erosion**: 
   - For instance, the use of armourstone as a revetment structure has been shown to stabilize shorelines effectively. The selection of armour stone sizes is based on stability requirements derived from the Hudson equation and tailored to the specific coastal conditions of the area (Design Brief - Phase II_DRAFT.pdf, p. 21). The new revetment structures aim to prevent further erosion, particularly in areas that have been previously undermined (Design Brief - Phase I.pdf, p. 20).

2. **Environmental Considerations**:
   - Smaller cobble sizes are considered more user-friendly for park environments, promoting recreational use while providing adequate protection against erosion. However, they may require more material to be effective compared to larger stones (Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, p. 20). This indicates a trade-off between ecological benefits and structural effectiveness.

3. **Impact Mitigation**:
   - The TRCA also evaluates the impact of construction on local coastal processes. New revetments are planned to occupy the same footprint as existing structures, thereby minimizing their impact on coastal dynamics (Design Brief - Phase II_DRAFT.pdf, p. 25).

4. **User Safety and Accessibility**:
   - During the design process, considerations are made for how these structures will affect public access and safety. For example, trails alongside the shoreline may need to be re-evaluated if the underlying substrate is undermined (Design Brief - Phase II_DRAFT.pdf, p. 8).

5. **Regulatory and Community Engagement**:
   - Decisions are often made in consultation with TRCA staff and other stakeholders to ensure that the chosen methods align with regulatory standards and community needs. The decision to proceed with specific strategies is influenced by the potential for reduced disturbance of the shoreline and lowered risk of erosion (Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project Concept Brief).

In summary, TRCA's decision-making for erosion control structures integrates technical analyses, environmental assessments, community input, and safety considerations, ensuring a balanced approach to shoreline management and preservation.
