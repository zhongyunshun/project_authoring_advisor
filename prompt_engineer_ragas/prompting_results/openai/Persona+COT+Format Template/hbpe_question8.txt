The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" outlines specific long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the newly installed erosion control measures. These strategies include:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and annually thereafter. This monitoring is essential to assess the condition and effectiveness of the erosion control measures and ensures that any necessary adjustments or repairs can be made in a timely manner.

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Prior to construction, erosion and sediment control measures will be implemented. These measures will be maintained throughout the construction phases to prevent sediment from entering the water bodies. Regular inspections will be conducted to repair or replace any damaged control measures.

3. **Adaptive Management**: The erosion and sediment control strategies are not static; they may need to be upgraded or amended based on changing site conditions. This adaptability aims to minimize sediment-laden runoff as construction proceeds.

4. **Long-term Maintenance**: Regular monitoring will be conducted during the maintenance phase to ensure all best management practices are being adhered to, thereby minimizing environmental disturbance and enhancing the effectiveness of the erosion control measures.

This approach aims to ensure the longevity and effectiveness of the erosion control measures, thereby protecting the shoreline and adjacent habitats from erosion risks.
