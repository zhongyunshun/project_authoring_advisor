The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity by specifically evaluating both bat species and butternut trees found in the project area.

1. **Butternut Trees**: According to the report, a Category 2 butternut has been identified within the project area. Butternuts are classified as an endangered species in North America and are protected under Ontario’s Endangered Species Act (Document 2). The project has planned to handle tree removals in a selective manner to minimize impacts, ensuring compliance with conservation regulations (Document 19).

2. **Bat Species**: The project brief notes the presence of bat habitat in the area, and it emphasizes that appropriate compensation measures will be coordinated to mitigate any potential effects from construction (Document 8). Additionally, the construction activities are planned to occur outside of the bird breeding window to minimize disturbances to wildlife and their habitats (Document 3). 

Overall, the project includes measures to protect these species by minimizing habitat disruption and ensuring any tree removals occur in a manner compliant with conservation laws, thereby addressing the importance of biodiversity conservation effectively.
