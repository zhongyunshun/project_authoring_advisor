The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" does not explicitly mention any future plans or subsequent phases for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope at Peacham Crescent. The document primarily details the existing stabilization project and its necessary remediation work to address the current slope instability in the area. 

If you require more specific details or updates regarding future phases, I recommend checking with the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) directly or monitoring their publications for announcements regarding future projects.
