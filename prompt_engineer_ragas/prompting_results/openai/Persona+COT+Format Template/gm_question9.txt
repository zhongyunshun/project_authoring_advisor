The involvement of local Indigenous communities in TRCA projects, such as those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay, is emphasized through a structured engagement process. 

1. **Indigenous Engagement Approach**: TRCA recognizes that Indigenous communities possess diverse perspectives and experiences, which are essential for project development. The engagement can take various forms tailored to the specific community and project's scope, ensuring relevance and appropriateness (Document 3, page 49).

2. **Consultation Practices**: For projects like the Peacham Crescent erosion control and slope stabilization project, TRCA has established a record of Indigenous community consultations, detailing the correspondence and discussions held with various Indigenous groups. For instance, consultations included groups such as the Beausoleil First Nation and Six Nations of the Grand River (Document 7, page 292; Document 13, page 50).

3. **Ongoing Relationships**: TRCA aims to build solid relationships with Aboriginal communities. This includes formal and informal partnerships aimed at fostering collaborative efforts in project development (Document 1, page 575). The community engagement aims to respect and incorporate the rights and interests of these communities throughout the project lifecycle (Document 11, page 576).

4. **Documentation of Engagement**: The results of the consultations are documented and used to inform project decisions and adjustments. For example, details about the nature of consultations are summarized in official documentation, providing insights into the communication methods and community responses (Document 9, page 49; Document 17, page 50).

Overall, TRCA is committed to ensuring that Indigenous communities are actively involved in relevant project discussions, recognizing their rights and contributions to sustainable watershed management.
