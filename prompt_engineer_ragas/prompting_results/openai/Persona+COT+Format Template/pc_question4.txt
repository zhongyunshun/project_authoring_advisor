To understand the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the Class Environmental Assessment (Class EA) for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, the document highlights several key points:

1. **Project Proponent**: The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) acts as the project proponent, responsible for initiating and overseeing the environmental assessment process.

2. **Public Involvement**: The TRCA ensures public consultation is integrated into the process. Stakeholders, including local residents and interest groups, are informed through notifications and are provided opportunities to give feedback at various stages of the project.

3. **Regulatory Authorities**: Regulatory bodies, including the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, play a crucial role in reviewing the assessment results and deciding on approvals or additional measures required before project implementation.

4. **Consultants and Experts**: External consultants may be engaged to provide specialized expertise pertaining to environmental assessments, engineering solutions, and mitigation strategies.

5. **Stakeholder Agencies**: Various governmental and non-governmental organizations may also have roles depending on their mandates aligned with environmental conservation, erosion control, or local community interests.

The specific procedures for consultation and collaboration with these stakeholders are outlined in the Class EA project documentation, ensuring transparency and a cooperative approach throughout the project phases.
