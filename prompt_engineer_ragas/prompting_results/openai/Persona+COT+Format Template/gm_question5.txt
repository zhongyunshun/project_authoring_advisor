The erosion control and slope stabilization efforts for both the Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent projects are structured into multiple phases.

1. **Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project**:
   - The project is divided into three phases. This approach is necessary due to the extensive area and multi-year nature of construction. The focus of these phases includes addressing erosion concerns and the restoration of the shoreline.

2. **Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project**:
   - Specific mentions in the documents do not detail future phases beyond what is currently planned. However, the project is framed within a Class Environmental Assessment (EA), indicating that ongoing assessments could lead to additional phases or refinements based on environmental impacts and local needs.

Both projects are aimed at providing long-term protection and maintenance of the regions, with a clear focus on erosion control as highlighted in the respective project documentation (Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project - HBPE Project Brief; Peacham Crescent Class EA Project Plan).

If you have more specific questions regarding the timeline or objectives of future phases, please let me know!
