The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" includes details about restoration plantings aimed at mitigating biodiversity loss and enhancing local ecosystems, particularly in regard to species at risk. 

### Contribution to Biodiversity Mitigation:
1. **Increase in Native Vegetation**: The restoration activities include the planting of suitable native species which are essential for supporting local biodiversity. Native species typically provide better habitat and food sources for wildlife compared to non-native species.
   
2. **Habitat Enhancement**: The project emphasizes creating and restoring habitats that are conducive to the survival of species at risk. By focusing on native plantings, the project aims to restore ecological functions and improve habitat structures that can support various species.

3. **Managing Invasive Species**: Efforts to remove invasive plant species within the project area will not only help in restoring native vegetation but also allow for a more resilient ecosystem that can better support at-risk species. The removal of invasive species can reduce competition for resources among native species.

4. **Restoration of Ecological Functions**: The restoration plans aim to improve hydrological processes, which are critical for maintaining wetland and aquatic habitats that many species rely upon. This is particularly important for species that are sensitive to changes in water quality and availability.

### Specific Measures:
- **Tree and Shrub Plantings**: The project anticipates planting a significant number of trees and shrubs as part of the site restoration, specifically mentioned are 105 trees that need to be removed to facilitate construction, with plans to compensate by planting 92 trees and 2,291 shrubs (source: Document 7, 2021-02-24 Project Brief_90 percent).

- **Ongoing Monitoring**: The project includes plans for post-planting monitoring to ensure the success of restoration efforts. This helps in making adaptations if the initial plantings do not thrive or if the habitat does not develop as expected to support at-risk species.

By integrating these strategies, the HBPE Project seeks to counteract biodiversity loss and promote the survival of species at risk within the project's ecological footprint.
