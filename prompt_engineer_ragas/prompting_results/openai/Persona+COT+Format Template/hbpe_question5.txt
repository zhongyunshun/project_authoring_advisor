The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is structured in three distinct phases for its design and implementation. As outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II," the future phases include:

1. **Phase I**: Already completed.
2. **Phase II**: Currently in progress, which focuses on the western headland. This phase includes works that were specifically designed to address environmental and structural concerns.
3. **Phase III**: Planned for the future, it will involve further enhancements, such as placing beach material to help retain the shoreline.

Each phase is critical to the overall maintenance and improvement of the park's shoreline, with specific restoration and monitoring activities planned after the completion of these phases. The project aims to ensure sustainable management of the waterfront and mitigate erosion issues.
