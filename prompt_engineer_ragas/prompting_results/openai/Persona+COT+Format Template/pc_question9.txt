The engagement of Indigenous communities in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project is documented within the TRCAâ€™s materials. Specifically, a full record of Indigenous community consultation, including all correspondence, is detailed in the "Record of Indigenous Engagement for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project," found in Appendix D of the project documentation.

Key points regarding the outcomes of this engagement include:

1. **Consultation Initiatives:** The TRCA initiated public notifications and consultations, which included interactions with several Indigenous communities, such as the Beausoleil First Nation and the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation.

2. **Public Response:** The project documentation indicates that there were ongoing discussions regarding public concerns, although there were no major public objections reported.

3. **Documentation of Engagement:** A comprehensive summary of the consultations is provided, ensuring transparency and that Indigenous perspectives were considered in the project planning.

These steps reflect a commitment to involving local Indigenous communities in environmental assessments and decision-making processes relating to the project. For detailed records and specific correspondence, one would need to refer directly to the documents mentioned, particularly in Appendix D.
