The Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project identifies that while there are no significant wildlife populations within the project limits, there are specific measures proposed to minimize impacts on local wildlife, notably concerning the protection of potential habitats.

1. **Timing of Construction**: Construction activities are planned to take place outside of the bird breeding season to prevent disturbances to avian species that may be nesting in the area.

2. **Selective Tree Removal**: Any required tree removals will be minimal and highly selective, aiming to preserve the overall welfare of vegetation communities within the parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent. This mitigates impacts on local wildlife by retaining critical habitats.

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Implementing erosion and sediment control measures, such as standard sediment control fencing around the work area, helps prevent deleterious materials from entering nearby habitats, thus protecting the ecosystem during construction.

4. **Monitoring and Adaptive Management**: The project also emphasizes conducting further ecological assessments and monitoring to adaptively manage and mitigate unforeseen impacts during the construction phase.

These measures are designed to ensure that the local wildlife, including any species at risk that may be indirectly affected, are adequately protected throughout the project, in line with the recommendations from the TRCA (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority) documentation. 

For broader wildlife considerations, refer to the TRCA's Arborist Report and Tree Preservation Plan related to the project for specific details on vegetation management and its ecological significance.
