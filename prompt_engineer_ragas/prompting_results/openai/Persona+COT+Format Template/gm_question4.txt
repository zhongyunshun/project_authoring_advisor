In the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project, various stakeholders play critical roles in ensuring the project's success. The main stakeholders include:

1. **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA)**: 
   - TRCA is responsible for leading the project, working in partnership with York Region to undertake environmental assessments and the implementation of sanitary infrastructure protection works. They oversee project planning, public consultation, and adherence to regulatory requirements.

2. **Local Municipalities (e.g., City of Markham)**:
   - The local municipalities collaborate with TRCA to ensure that the project aligns with local infrastructure needs and community interests. They may assist in facilitating public engagement sessions and providing local insights regarding potential impacts and benefits.

3. **Engineering Firms (e.g., Greck and Associates Limited)**:
   - Engineering firms are contracted to conduct detailed assessments, design infrastructure solutions, and evaluate alternatives for the protection works. They provide technical expertise necessary for the feasibility studies and environmental assessments required under municipal class environmental assessment processes.

Together, these stakeholders work collaboratively to address erosion issues and enhance infrastructure protection while considering environmental sustainability and community engagement. This partnership approach is crucial in navigating the complexities involved in such civil works, ensuring all perspectives are included and that project objectives are met effectively.
