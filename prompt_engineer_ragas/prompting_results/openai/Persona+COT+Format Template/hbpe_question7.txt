The selection of erosion control structures in the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief" is grounded in their effectiveness in addressing erosion concerns, adaptability to the existing environment, and the overall impact on the surrounding ecosystem. Here are some of the key considerations highlighted in the document:

1. **Structural Stability and Condition**: The existing erosion control structures, such as the armourstone headlands, were assessed for their stability and overall condition. For instance, the armourstone headland at the western limit (WF11.10) was marked as "Failing Fair," indicating that, while functional, it required maintenance due to minor displacement of materials (Document 3, page 5).

2. **Environmental Appropriateness**: The choice of materials, such as cobble or rubble for beaches (e.g., WF11.11), was influenced by their ability to provide a suitable habitat while mitigating erosion. Cobble sizes were recommended to ensure a user-friendly beach environment while still offering adequate protection against wave action (Document 11, page 20).

3. **Hydrological Considerations**: Erosion control designs incorporated hydrological factors, particularly in response to elevated water levels. The irregular profiles of headlands and beaches were analyzed for their risks of flooding and erosion during high lake levels, suggesting the need for redesign (Document 6, page 7).

4. **Community and User Impact**: The implications of the erosion control structures on park users were also an important factor. Designs aimed to balance the functional aspects of protecting the shoreline with maintaining accessibility and aesthetic values for users (Document 17, page 19). 

5. **Project Outcomes and Maintenance Plans**: The proposed solutions, including the construction of new berms and additional stone placements, were shaped by previous assessments of wave overtopping and erosion risks, focusing on long-term viability and maintenance needs (Document 5, page 15).

In summary, the choice of erosion control measures in the Humber Bay Park East project was a multidimensional decision, incorporating structural integrity, environmental impact, hydrological context, and user experience. The overall aim was to implement effective solutions while minimizing negative repercussions on the local ecosystem and park utilization.
