The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects such as the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project include several key components:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring:** Sites will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and annually thereafter. This monitoring is essential to ensure that the erosion control measures function effectively and maintain their structural integrity over time (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I & II).

2. **Site Restoration:** Restoration efforts, which may involve regrading and seeding, are implemented post-construction to enhance site resilience and recovery (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I).

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures:** Before construction begins, staging and stockpiling areas are isolated with standard silt socks to prevent sediment dispersion and ensure the quality of surrounding environments is maintained (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I & II).

4. **Detailed Inspections and Assessments:** Continued assessments of the overall condition of erosion control structures will be performed as part of regular maintenance. This includes evaluating structural stability and identifying any deficiencies that may arise (Source: Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief).

5. **Implementation of Recommendations:** Any recommendations arising from monitoring efforts will be addressed to ensure ongoing effectiveness and safety of the erosion control measures (Source: Design Brief - Phase I).

These strategies reflect the commitment to maintaining the functionality of erosion control structures while promoting ecological restoration and stability in the Humber Bay Park East area. If you have more specific queries or need additional information, please let me know!
