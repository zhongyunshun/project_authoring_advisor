The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several measures aimed at protecting local wildlife, particularly aquatic species highlighted in the baseline inventory. 

1. **Baseline Inventory and Monitoring**: Prior to any construction, a comprehensive baseline inventory was conducted that included aquatic species monitoring. This data helps guide all construction activities to minimize impacts on local wildlife (Source: Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project â€“ Concept Brief).

2. **Habitat Preservation**: The project involves coordination among various stakeholders, including the TRCA and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), to develop and maintain aquatic habitats. These discussions focus on the conservation of identified aquatic species, including both native and invasive species (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I).

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control**: Erosion and sediment control measures will be implemented prior to construction. This includes the establishment of staging and stockpiling areas isolated with silt socks to ensure sediments do not disturb aquatic environments during and after construction activities (Sources: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I and Phase II).

4. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After the completion of major construction activities, regular inspections will be conducted to assess the site's condition, especially after significant storm events, thereby ensuring the long-term health of aquatic habitats (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase II).

5. **Tree Protection and Relocation**: During site setup, tree protection barriers will be erected as needed, and measures will be taken to relocate bird nesting boxes to protect local avian species that could be affected by construction (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I).

Overall, these strategies aim to effectively mitigate disruptions to aquatic wildlife and ensure the sustainability of the local ecosystems throughout the project's duration.
