The detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East, as outlined in the "Design Brief - Phase II" document, addresses several engineering challenges and considerations. Key aspects include:

1. **Erosion and Sediment Control**: The design emphasizes the need for effective erosion control measures, especially in high-wave action areas. The shoreline has been evaluated to address existing erosion concerns, including low crest elevation and wave overtopping.

2. **Site Condition Assessment**: Shoreplan Engineering conducted multiple site visits to assess existing conditions and inform the detailed design. This includes considering the native material composition of the shoreline and potential contamination risks.

3. **Wave Overtopping**: The design process rigorously considers wave overtopping rates and the potential impact on infrastructure and ecological features. This is crucial for ensuring the longevity and effectiveness of the shoreline protection.

4. **Habitat Features**: The inclusion of habitat features was a significant part of the design, especially for the transition zones. These features aim to enhance the ecological value of the shoreline while providing structural support.

5. **Construction Costs and Design Considerations**: Detailed estimations regarding construction costs and the structural capabilities needed to withstand dynamic lake conditions were assessed. This ensures that the design is both economically feasible and technically robust.

The document reflects a commitment to both engineering efficiency and environmental protection, crucial for a project of this nature. For more specific details, you may consult page 25 and other relevant sections of the "Design Brief - Phase II" document, where these challenges are elaborated.
