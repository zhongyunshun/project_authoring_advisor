The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project addresses tree removals and restoration plantings as crucial elements to mitigate biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk like the butternut tree and bats.

1. **Tree Removals**: According to the TRCA documents, tree removals are planned to be minimal and highly selective to reduce impacts on the existing vegetation and wildlife populations. Specifically, the project aims to ensure that the removals will have negligible impacts on the welfare of vegetation communities in the area (Document 16). This selective approach helps maintain habitat for various species, including those that may be at risk.

2. **Restoration Plantings**: The restoration work includes planting suitable native species to enhance soil stability, reduce erosion, and increase local biodiversity once established (Document 6). The planted vegetation is expected to provide essential habitats and support the existing ecosystem, which is particularly important for species at risk.

3. **Species at Risk**: The butternut tree, which is classified as endangered and protected under Ontarioâ€™s Endangered Species Act, is specifically mentioned in the project documentation. Efforts to protect and potentially recover butternut populations are included in the planning, with strategies such as avoiding impacts from tree removal and supporting conservation (Document 21). Additionally, the construction activities are scheduled to occur outside of bird breeding windows to minimize disturbances (Document 13).

4. **Biodiversity Gains**: The ecological studies conducted indicate that, while there may be short-term disruptions due to tree removals, the long-term benefits of restoration planting are expected to outweigh these impacts. Once native species are established, they are anticipated to enhance habitat quality and foster a diverse ecosystem (Document 9).

In summary, the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project incorporates careful planning and restoration strategies to mitigate biodiversity loss and support species at risk, like butternut and bats, by ensuring minimal impact during tree removals and promoting the growth of native vegetation as part of the ecological recovery efforts.
