The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project is primarily focused on addressing hazards related to slope instability that could impact residential properties and public safety in the area. According to the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) documents, the project aims to mitigate risks associated with slope failure, particularly for the homes located at 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent. 

To address potential social impacts and ensure community safety, the project includes several key actions:

1. **Risk Mitigation**: The primary purpose is to prevent slope failures that could pose risks to human life and property. The project involves assessing and stabilizing the slope to avoid hazards related to erosion and slippage (Document 21, Page 11).

2. **Public Notifications and Consultation**: In accordance with the Class Environmental Assessment (Class EA) process, the project will include public notifications to keep the community informed about the project's progress and potential impacts (Document 18, Page 48).

3. **Sediment Control Measures**: Before any construction begins, protocols such as standard sediment control fencing will be implemented to prevent ecological disturbance and protect local water quality (Document 13, Page 15).

4. **Assessment of Impacts**: An evaluation of potential effects from construction is included in the project planning, which looks into the biological, historical, and environmental aspects to minimize adverse outcomes (Document 6, Page 46; Document 15, Page 47).

5. **Public Safety Considerations**: The planning documents indicate that there is an established factor of safety parameter (set at 1.5) to ensure that the stabilization measures are effective in maintaining the integrity of the slope which is vital for protecting the residential community from any geotechnical risks (Document 2, Page 17; Document 14, Page 2).

By incorporating these measures, the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project endeavors to not only stabilize the slopes but also ensure the safety and well-being of the local residents.
