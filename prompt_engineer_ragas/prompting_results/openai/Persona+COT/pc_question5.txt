The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" does not explicitly mention any future plans or subsequent phases for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope at Peacham Crescent. The document primarily details the existing conditions, the proposed remedial works, and immediate erosion control measures.

For additional inquiries or future projects, it might be beneficial to consult updates from the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) or related municipal planning documents.
