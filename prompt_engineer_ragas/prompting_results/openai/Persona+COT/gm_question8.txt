The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects like the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project include post-construction inspections. According to the technical documents from the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), the site will be inspected during the first year following major storm events and will also undergo annual inspections thereafter. This strategy aims to ensure the integrity and functionality of the erosion control measures over time.

Furthermore, there will be site restoration activities, such as regrading and seeding, as part of the project's maintenance and monitoring protocols to enhance the site's ecological quality and aesthetic value (see Reference: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I, pages 34 and 36).
