The "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" outlines various roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the Class Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project. Here are some key points regarding stakeholder involvement:

1. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Initial public notifications and consultations are part of the EA process, ensuring that stakeholders are informed and can provide input on the project. The first point of public contact typically occurs through published materials outlining the project's purpose and details (Document 3).

2. **Roles of Regulatory Authorities**: The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) serves as the primary regulatory body overseeing the project, ensuring compliance with environmental standards and guidelines under the Class EA framework (Document 1).

3. **Public Input and Consideration**: Stakeholders, including residents and community groups, have the opportunity to voice concerns and suggestions. These inputs are considered in the decision-making process, shaping the project's direction to better address community needs (Document 21).

4. **Inter-Agency Collaboration**: Various agencies may be engaged in the process to provide expertise and ensure a comprehensive assessment, including environmental scientists and urban planners. Their roles involve assessing environmental impacts and ensuring that the project aligns with broader land use and ecosystem management goals (Document 19).

5. **Final Decision-Making**: The outcomes of the consultations and assessments guide the decision-making process, which may involve referrals to higher authorities if significant environmental impacts are identified. Ultimately, the Minister of the Environment may make a final decision in matters of significant concern (Document 9).

The integration of these roles and responsibilities ensures a collaborative approach, promoting transparency and sustainability in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project.
