In the development and implementation of TRCA projects such as those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay, local Indigenous communities are consulted and involved through a structured engagement process. 

**Peacham Crescent Consultation**:
1. The TRCA has recognized the importance of consulting Indigenous communities whose rights and interests may be affected by proposed projects. This includes outreach to various Indigenous groups, such as the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, Six Nations of the Grand River, and others (Document 11).
2. The process involves multiple forms of engagement, tailored to the specific community and project scope. This may include formal meetings, correspondence, and public notifications as part of the Class Environmental Assessment (EA) process (Documents 3 and 19).
3. A Record of Indigenous Engagement is maintained to document all correspondence and consultations that take place, ensuring transparency and accountability (Document 13).

**Humber Bay Involvement**:
1. Similar engagement practices are applied at Humber Bay, where the TRCA actively consults with local Indigenous communities. This engagement reflects the specific characteristics and interests of the communities involved, ensuring their perspectives are considered in decision-making (Documents 4 and 16).
2. The TRCA emphasizes building positive relationships with Indigenous groups, which is crucial for sustainable community development and watershed management (Document 12).

In summary, the TRCA implements a comprehensive Indigenous engagement process to foster collaboration with local communities, ensuring their knowledge and interests are incorporated into project planning and execution.
