The findings from the Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project indicate that there are no significant wildlife populations identified within the project limits. As such, the anticipated impacts on local wildlife are expected to be minimal. Specifically, the project planners aim to mitigate any impacts on wildlife through strategic construction practices.

Key proposed mitigation measures include:

1. **Selective Removal of Vegetation**: Minimizing the removal and disturbance of existing vegetation, which supports local ecosystems, helps maintain habitat for wildlife.

2. **Timing of Construction Activities**: Construction activities are scheduled to occur outside of the bird breeding window to avoid disrupting breeding populations.

3. **Sediment Control Fencing**: Prior to construction, standard sediment control fencing will be installed to prevent the entry of deleterious materials into sensitive areas, further protecting the local wildlife habitat.

4. **Monitoring and Adaptive Management**: Ongoing monitoring throughout the project could lead to adaptive management measures being implemented to address any unforeseen impacts on the local ecosystem.

These measures aim to ensure that even with construction activities, the integrity of local wildlife habitats and the surrounding environment is preserved (Document 1, Document 16, Document 18). 

For more detailed information specific to any identified species at risk or additional wildlife-related concerns, it would be advisable to consult the TRCAâ€™s Arborist Report and Tree Preservation Plan for the project, which includes a more thorough assessment of ecological considerations (Document 6).
