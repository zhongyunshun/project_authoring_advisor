The engagement of Indigenous communities in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project is detailed in the *Record of Indigenous Engagement* found in Appendix D of the project's documentation. This record includes a full account of consultations with Indigenous communities, documenting all correspondence related to their involvement.

The specific Indigenous groups consulted include:

- Beausoleil First Nation
- Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation
- Chippewas of Rama-Mnjikaning First Nation
- Huron-Wendat Nation

These consultations were aimed at addressing community concerns and integrating Indigenous perspectives into project planning. Although the outcome details from the engagement process are not fully spelled out in the retrieved documents, it is evident that the consultations provided a platform for Indigenous stakeholders to express their insights regarding the project.

For instance, the documents outline public notifications and consultation processes that coincide with the Class Environmental Assessment (EA) framework, underscoring the emphasis placed on engaging the public, including Indigenous communities. The results of these engagements would be expected to influence project decisions, addressing any expressed concerns, although specific outcomes are not explicitly documented in the provided excerpts.
