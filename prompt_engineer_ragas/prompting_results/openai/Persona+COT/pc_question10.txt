The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity with a specific focus on bat species and butternut trees in the following ways:

1. **Bat Species**: The project acknowledges the presence of bat habitat within the project area. To mitigate impacts on these species, the brief indicates that appropriate compensation and measures will be coordinated. This suggests a commitment to ensuring that any alterations to the habitat are handled thoughtfully to minimize disruption to the bat populations.

2. **Butternut Trees**: The brief identifies a Category 2 butternut tree within the project area, noting that butternuts are classified as an endangered species protected under Ontarioâ€™s Endangered Species Act. This recognition emphasizes the importance of conserving these trees and suggests that the project's planning includes strategies to avoid or minimize harm to this species. Specific management measures, including selective tree removals, are aimed at protecting biodiversity and ensuring the overall health of vegetation communities.

Additionally, the project is planned to occur outside of bird breeding windows to further minimize ecological disruption, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to biodiversity conservation during the construction activities.

For more detailed information regarding these biodiversity considerations, please refer to the 2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief and the associated biological surveys conducted by the TRCA.
