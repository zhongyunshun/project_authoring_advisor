The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" outlines several long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the newly installed erosion control measures. Key strategies include:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will undergo inspections during the first year after major storm events and annually thereafter. This monitoring is designed to ensure the effectiveness of the erosion control measures in mitigating any damage caused by significant weather events.

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: These measures will be implemented before and maintained during construction to prevent sediment entry into the water. This includes the use of silt socks and other best management practices to minimize erosion and sedimentation.

3. **Adaptive Management**: The erosion and sediment control strategies are not static and may need to be modified as site conditions change to ensure continued effectiveness. This adaptive approach involves ongoing assessment and upgrades to the strategies in response to observed conditions.

4. **Monitoring Protocols**: There will be a focus on regular monitoring by trained professionals, who will ensure that best management practices are adhered to throughout the lifecycle of the project. They will document any damages or required repairs to the erosion control measures.

5. **Site Restoration Efforts**: Restoration activities, such as regrading and seeding, will occur to ensure the ecological stability of the area after construction. Effective erosion and sediment control measures will be maintained until the site is fully revegetated.

These strategies aim to enhance the long-term resilience of the shoreline against erosion and ensure the success of environmental restoration efforts in the project area.
