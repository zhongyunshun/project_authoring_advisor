The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" outlines the shoreline maintenance project's impact on local wildlife, particularly aquatic species, through various assessments and documentation. The baseline inventory, specifically in the aquatic habitat components section, indicates ongoing discussions between the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), the City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat, which implies proactive measures are being taken to assess potential effects on local species.

The project documentation mentions several aquatic species, including:
- Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) - noted as invasive.
- Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax) - categorized as native/introduced.
- Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and others listed in the project brief.

The potential impacts of shoreline construction activities can include habitat alteration and loss, as inferred from reports of aquatic habitat components and previous assessments. Specific mitigation measures are anticipated to be taken to lessen these impacts and enhance habitat structures, such as creating surcharged revetment which can provide substrate for aquatic species and facilitate reproduction.

Moreover, the restoration and monitoring plans post-construction emphasize the oversight of ecological health to ensure a balanced environment for aquatic life at Humber Bay Park East.
