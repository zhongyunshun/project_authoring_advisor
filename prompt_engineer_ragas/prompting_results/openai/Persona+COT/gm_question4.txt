In the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project, various stakeholders play crucial roles to ensure the project's success. Hereâ€™s an outline of their specific responsibilities:

1. **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA)**: 
   - TRCA is primarily responsible for leading the project in partnership with the Regional Municipality of York. Their duties include conducting environmental assessments, overseeing project development, and ensuring that the sanitary infrastructure protection works address erosion issues effectively along German Mills Creek.

2. **Regional Municipality of York**: 
   - The municipality collaborates with TRCA in planning and implementing protective measures for the sanitary infrastructure. It also contributes local insights and resources necessary for effective project execution.

3. **Engineering Firms (e.g., Greck and Associates Limited)**:
   - These firms are typically engaged to conduct technical assessments and evaluations of the infrastructure. Their work includes assessing environmental implications, evaluating alternative sites for construction, and offering engineering solutions tailored to the project's needs.

4. **First Nations and Indigenous Groups**: 
   - The project's development involves consultations with Indigenous groups to address any cultural or environmental concerns. This engagement ensures that the project aligns with Indigenous engagement guidelines and respects the rights and interests of local communities.

5. **Community Stakeholders and Public**: 
   - Local residents and community groups are also stakeholders who may provide input through public consultations. Their feedback can guide the project's design and execution, helping to balance environmental sustainability with community interests.

Through the collaboration of these stakeholders, the project aims to protect the sanitary infrastructure while enhancing the surrounding habitat and ensuring the public's enjoyment of the area.

These insights are derived from the project documentation, specifically focusing on stakeholder roles and interactions outlined in the TRCA's Environmental Assessment and project briefs.
