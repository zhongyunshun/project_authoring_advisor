The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is structured around a phased approach due to the extensive area and long-term nature of the work. It consists of three distinct phases for design and implementation, although the specific details and timelines for Phases II and III are not explicitly stated in the retrieved documents available.

As for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, while the documents mention concerns regarding erosion and stabilization, they do not indicate specific future phases or expansions directly related to it within the current context.

For detailed planning, future expansions, or specific timelines beyond what has been documented, it might be beneficial to check the latest updates from the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority or related municipal resources.
