The anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, as outlined in the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP," include considerations for biological impacts, existing vegetation, wildlife populations, and community engagement.

1. **Environmental Impacts**:
   - **Biological Impacts**: The assessment indicates that there are no significant wildlife populations within the project limits, and thus no anticipated negative impacts on local wildlife (source: Document 9, page 28). Additionally, the project is planned to minimize impacts on existing natural habitat, with all construction activities designed to reduce disruption (source: Document 18, page 26).
   - **Vegetation**: It is noted that the project aims to have less impact on vegetation and soil removal compared to alternative designs, providing an opportunity to improve drainage and manage stormwater runoff effectively (source: Document 8, page 44).
   - **Unique Landforms**: There are no known unique landforms in the project area, indicating minimal expected geological impact (source: Document 10, page 23).

2. **Social Impacts**:
   - **Public Consultation**: The Class EA process involves public notifications and consultations to ensure community voices are heard and considered throughout the project's planning and implementation phases (source: Document 4, page 48).
   - **Safety and Property Protection**: The primary objective of the project is to protect human life and property from hazards associated with erosion, which addresses community safety concerns (source: Document 3, page 7).

3. **Impact Mitigation Measures**: 
   - The project follows the Class Environmental Assessment for Remedial Flood and Erosion Control Projects, established to create long-term, low-maintenance solutions to slope instability issues while mitigating potential impacts (source: Document 5, page 3).

Overall, the project is designed to address environmental concerns proactively, safeguard local ecosystems, and engage with the community to consider their interests and needs.
