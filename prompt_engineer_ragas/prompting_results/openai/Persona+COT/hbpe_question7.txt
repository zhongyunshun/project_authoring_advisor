The selection of erosion control structures at Humber Bay Park East involves careful consideration of their effectiveness and potential environmental impacts. In the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief", various structures like armourstone headlands and gravel beaches were assessed based on their ability to mitigate erosion while also considering the ecological integrity of the area.

1. **Armourstone Structures**: These were chosen for their structural stability and durability, proving effective against the forces of water and wave action. For example, the eastern armourstone headland (designated WF11.12) exhibited visible displacements and erosion concerns, indicating that while these structures offer protection, maintenance and adjustments are necessary to counteract movement and scouring.

2. **Gravel/Cobble Beaches**: This type of structure was proposed for areas where user-friendliness is a priority. Although effective in creating habitats and recreational spaces, their design needs to ensure that they are not prone to scouring or undercutting, which can lead to further erosion. The brief mentions that smaller cobble sizes may provide a better experience for visitors while requiring careful management of the materials to ensure safety and functionality.

3. **Environmental Impact Considerations**: Evaluating the potential impacts involved assessing existing conditions, such as the irregular profiles of shorelines which have resulted from previous high-water events. The proposed designs aim to balance protective measures with the need to support the local ecosystem, such as maintaining habitats for wildlife and recreational access for park users.

Overall, the choice of erosion control methods in the project reflects a multidisciplinary approach, balancing human use with environmental stewardship (TRCA, 2021).
