The "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final" outlines several key factors that influenced the selection of preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives for the sites behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent. These factors include:

1. **Factor of Safety (FOS)**: The conceptual stabilization options were developed based on a requested Factor of Safety of 1.3, which assessed the stability of the slopes and ensured that the proposed solutions would adequately address the risk of erosion and slope failure.

2. **Geotechnical Assessment**: Recommendations from geotechnical assessments provided critical information about the composition and existing conditions of subsurface materials, which played a vital role in determining feasible stabilization methods.

3. **Environmental Considerations**: Evaluations included analyzing the potential environmental impacts of each alternative. The preferred solutions aimed to minimize adverse effects on existing vegetation and soil removal.

4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Economic feasibility was a significant factor, where the costs associated with the maintenance and construction of each stabilization method were assessed.

5. **Constructability**: The practicality of implementing each alternative within the specified site conditions was considered, ensuring that the chosen methods could be effectively executed.

6. **Public and Stakeholder Input**: The evaluation process also involved a thirty-day review period for stakeholders and the public, allowing for concerns and suggestions to be integrated into the final decision-making process.

This comprehensive evaluation led to the identification of the most suitable approach for slope stabilization in the project area, particularly the Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) structure as the preferred alternative.
