The restoration plantings described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" contribute to biodiversity conservation and mitigate against biodiversity loss in several ways, particularly in regard to species at risk:

1. **Use of Native Species**: The restoration efforts emphasize the planting of suitable native species. This is critical for supporting local biodiversity and ensuring that the ecosystem can thrive, as native plants provide the necessary habitat and food sources for local wildlife, including species at risk.

2. **Compensatory Planting**: The project notes that restoration activities include significant compensatory planting plans, aimed at offsetting any negative effects resulting from construction activities. For example, specific numbers of trees and shrubs are planned to be planted to replace those that may be removed during construction. Such measures are essential to maintaining populations of species at risk by providing them with the habitat they need to recover and persist.

3. **Enhancement of Ecological Functions**: Steps are outlined to mitigate habitat disturbances caused by the project. Restoration activities focus on creating a more robust local environment through comprehensive restoration plans that not only rebuild local habitats but also create linkages or corridors that are important for the movement and dispersal of species, including those that are endangered or threatened.

4. **Monitoring and Adaptation**: The project framework includes monitoring to evaluate the success of the restoration efforts. By assessing how well the re-established environments support biodiversity over time, managers can adapt strategies as needed to enhance outcomes for species at risk.

In conclusion, the restoration strategies implemented in the HBPE Project are thoughtfully designed to address biodiversity loss, safeguard habitats, and promote the recovery of species at risk, aligning with TRCA's overarching goals of ecosystem restoration and conservation.
