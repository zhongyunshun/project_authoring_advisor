The "Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project" is planned to be implemented in three distinct phases. The future phases or expansions include:

1. **Phase I**: This phase involves initial site setup and restoration efforts.
2. **Phase II**: Currently under focus, this phase includes the construction of the Western Headland and various site restoration activities. This phase aims to enhance the park's shoreline resilience and ecological health.
3. **Phase III**: Although specific details on Phase III are not elaborated in the excerpts, it is mentioned that the Phase III works will include beach material placement to the east of the structures involved in the previous phases.

Overall, the project's phasing is structured to address the multi-year construction process across the Humber Bay Park area effectively.
