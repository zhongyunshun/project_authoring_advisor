The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several measures aimed at protecting local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory. Here are some key strategies based on the TRCA's technical documents:

1. **Baseline Inventory**: A comprehensive baseline inventory was conducted, including aquatic monitoring, to assess and document existing species and habitats. This data is crucial for understanding potential impacts and for planning mitigation strategies (Source: Document 1 & Document 3).

2. **Aquatic Habitat Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of aquatic habitats is planned, involving discussions between TRCA, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), and others, to ensure that modifications do not negatively affect local aquatic species (Source: Document 7).

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control**: Measures such as standard silt socks will be employed around staging and stockpiling areas prior to construction. This will help minimize soil erosion and sedimentation during project activities, thereby protecting water quality and aquatic habitats (Source: Document 8 & Document 9).

4. **Tree Protection**: The project includes the establishment of tree protection barriers to prevent damage to important vegetation that supports local wildlife. The barriers will ensure that no grade changes or storage of materials occurs in sensitive areas (Source: Document 12).

5. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After construction, the site will be subject to inspections during major storm events and annually thereafter. This ongoing monitoring will help assess the recovery of aquatic habitats and ensure long-term protection of local wildlife (Source: Document 22).

These measures demonstrate a commitment to minimizing disruption to aquatic species and preserving the ecological integrity of Humber Bay Park East throughout the project's various phases.
