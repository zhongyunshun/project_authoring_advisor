Engagement with Indigenous communities during the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project included a structured consultation approach. According to the documentation, a comprehensive record of Indigenous community consultation and all correspondence is detailed in the Record of Indigenous Engagement included in Appendix D of the Class EA Project Plan (Document 1, Page 50). 

Additionally, the project engaged various Indigenous groups, including the Beausoleil First Nation, Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, Chippewas of Rama-Mnjikaning First Nation, and Huron-Wendat Nation (Document 3, Page 50). The outcomes of these engagements included addressing concerns raised by the communities, which are highlighted under the section discussing public concerns in the project documentation (Document 1, Page 50). However, specific outcomes stemming from these engagements were not detailed in the provided excerpts, suggesting a need for deeper examination of the full engagement records in Appendix D for a comprehensive understanding.

This information reflects the efforts made by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) to incorporate Indigenous perspectives in their planning processes, ensuring that local communities were heard and considered in the decision-making for this project.
