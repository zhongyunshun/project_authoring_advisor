The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" include the following specifics:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**:
   - The site will undergo inspections during the first year after significant storm events and on an annual basis afterward to ensure the effectiveness of erosion control measures and overall site conditions (Document 1, page 36).

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**:
   - Erosion and sediment control (ESC) measures must be implemented before and maintained throughout the construction phases to prevent sediment from entering water bodies. Regular repairs and updates to these measures may be required based on the effectiveness observed during the project (Document 5, page 4 and Document 6, page 4).

3. **Site Restoration and Monitoring**:
   - Site restoration for Phase I will be limited to tasks such as regrading and seeding to support vegetation regrowth and stabilize the area post-construction. Continued monitoring to assess the success of these restoration activities will be part of the long-term management plan (Document 9, page 34).

These strategies are designed to ensure that the erosion control measures remain effective over time, contributing to the project's objectives of protecting the shoreline and maintaining ecological integrity.
