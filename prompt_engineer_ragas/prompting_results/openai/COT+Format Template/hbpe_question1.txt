To address your query about the specific engineering challenges and considerations related to the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East as documented in "Design Brief - Phase II," I'll refer to the relevant passages from the retrieved documents.

### Engineering Challenges and Considerations:
1. **Site Assessment**: The design process began with a thorough evaluation of existing site conditions. This included understanding the shoreline dynamics, erosion patterns, and potential contamination of native materials (Document 12, page 22).

2. **Erosion Control**: The challenges posed by erosion were critical. The design aimed to mitigate wave overtopping by proposing solutions that addressed low crest elevation and potential wave action impacting the shoreline (Document 14, page 15).

3. **Vegetation and Habitat Restoration**: The documents discuss integrating habitat features as part of erosion control measures. For example, specific designs included installing habitat features, such as surcharged stone, to promote ecological balance while ensuring structural integrity (Document 21, page 30).

4. **Construction Logistics**: Considerations regarding staging areas, material stockpiling, and environmental management during construction were highlighted. The careful selection and management of these areas were necessary to prevent disruption to the surrounding ecology and to facilitate smooth project execution (Document 10, page 26).

5. **Environmental Impact and Regulations**: The design team had to factor in environmental regulations and potential impacts on local ecosystems, which affected the engineering choices made. Control measures for erosion and sediment were also part of project planning (Document 8, page 33).

6. **Cost and Design Feasibility**: Engineering challenges also included evaluating construction costs associated with various design options. This step was crucial to ensure that proposed measures were feasible within budget constraints while achieving the desired protection levels (Document 16, page 25).

In summary, the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East faced multi-faceted engineering challenges that necessitated a balanced approach, integrating ecological consideration with structural needs.
