To determine the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the Class Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project as outlined in the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP," we can reference the information from the retrieved documents. 

However, the specific details regarding stakeholder roles were not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts. Typically in a Class EA, stakeholders may include local government bodies, community organizations, the general public, and the project management team from the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). They usually collaborate on the assessment process by providing input, feedback, and necessary approvals.

For a more comprehensive understanding, including detailed stakeholder roles, I recommend consulting the sections of the document that discuss public consultations, notifications, and stakeholder engagement, such as Document 3 ("Public Notifications and Consultation") and other relevant sections on stakeholder involvement. 

Would you like me to provide a broader overview of the Class EA process or specifics on public consultation practices?
