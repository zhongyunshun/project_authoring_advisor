The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity with specific mention of bat species and butternut trees through careful planning and mitigation strategies.

1. **Butternut Trees**: The project brief identifies a Category 2 butternut tree within the project area. It notes the species is endangered and protected under Ontario’s Endangered Species Act, which mandates that protective measures be taken to mitigate any negative impacts. The brief emphasizes that any tree removals will be minimal and selective, aimed at preserving the health of the remaining vegetation and biodiversity.

2. **Bat Species**: The project includes an ecological survey that identifies bat habitat in the area. The brief stipulates that all construction activities would occur outside the bird breeding window to minimize disturbance to breeding birds, indicating a broader sensitivity to the wildlife present. Furthermore, the document also hints at potential compensation measures for any impacts on bat habitats, although specific details on these measures are less defined in the excerpts available.

Both species' protection reflects the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority's commitment to biodiversity conservation, ensuring that construction works are conducted minimally and with respect to existing ecosystems. For further detailed impacts and monitoring strategies, refer to TRCA’s broader biological inventory and surveys mentioned within the documents (e.g., the Biological Inventory Memo from December 2018).
