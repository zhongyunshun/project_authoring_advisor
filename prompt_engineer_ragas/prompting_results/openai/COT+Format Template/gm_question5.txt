The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is indeed structured into multiple phases, due to the project's extensive scope and multi-year construction timeline. The project has been divided into three phases for design and implementation.

As for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, the documentation does not specify future phases or expansions beyond the current plans outlined. The emphasis has been primarily on addressing existing erosion and stabilization needs within the defined project limits.

If you require more recent or specific updates on expansions or future phases for either project, it may be beneficial to consult with the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) or check their official reports and announcements for any developments post-October 2023.
