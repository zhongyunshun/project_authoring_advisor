The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project includes specific long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the erosion control measures implemented. According to the project briefs and design reports, these strategies involve:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The newly installed erosion control structures will be inspected during the first year after significant storm events and on an annual basis thereafter. This ongoing inspection process aims to assess the integrity and effectiveness of the erosion control measures and ensure they are performing as intended (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 36 and Phase II.pdf, page 37).

2. **Site Restoration and Maintenance**: For the site restoration associated with these projects, measures such as regrading and seeding are planned post-construction. This helps in restoring the natural habitat and preventing further erosion (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 34).

3. **Regular Inspections of Erosion Control Structures**: A detailed assessment of the condition of existing erosion control structures is conducted to determine their stability and overall condition, which helps inform any necessary maintenance actions (Source: Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 5).

4. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Prior to and during construction, specific erosion and sediment control measures are implemented, including using silt socks to isolate staging and stockpiling areas, which contribute to long-term erosion management (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 32).

These strategies are essential for ensuring sustained effectiveness in preventing erosion and protecting the shoreline within Humber Bay Park East.
