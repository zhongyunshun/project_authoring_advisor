The "Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project: Phase II" document outlines several measures that address the potential impacts of the project on local wildlife, particularly aquatic species. 

Based on the baseline inventory, the project recognizes the importance of aquatic habitats and includes specific measures to mitigate potential negative effects on these environments. The following impacts and considerations regarding local wildlife, especially aquatic species, are noted:

1. **Aquatic Habitat Alteration**: The project acknowledges that construction activities can alter existing aquatic habitats, leading to potential loss or changes in the habitat availability for various species. These alterations are closely monitored to minimize disturbances, particularly during construction phases.

2. **Baseline Inventory**: A comprehensive baseline inventory was conducted to assess the existing conditions of aquatic habitats and the species present. This information is crucial for understanding how the proposed maintenance work may affect these habitats. The inventory is detailed in sections that cover various aquatic species, including their counts and classifications (e.g., native, invasive).

3. **Mitigation Measures**: The Technical Memo mentions that TRCA will implement mitigation measures during construction to protect aquatic habitats. These measures may include avoiding in-water work, controlling sediment runoff, and managing physical disturbances to minimize impacts on local biodiversity.

4. **Restoration Efforts**: Post-construction, restoration efforts will focus on re-establishing and improving aquatic habitats. Plans for restoration planting that include native species aim to help recovery and enhance the ecological value of the shoreline.

5. **Monitoring and Management**: Ongoing monitoring of the aquatic habitats and species will continue, allowing for adaptive management strategies that ensure compliance with environmental standards and regulations.

Overall, the documents indicate that the TRCA is actively considering the health and viability of local aquatic species through careful planning, monitoring, and mitigation strategies associated with the shoreline maintenance projects.
