To address your query about the specific measures proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, particularly concerning species identified in the vicinity of the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, I will refer to the relevant sections of the TRCA documents related to this project.

### Mitigation Measures for Wildlife
1. **Construction Timing**: To minimize impacts on bird habitat, particularly breeding birds, construction activities are scheduled to occur outside of the bird breeding window. This timing is crucial to reduce disturbances during critical life stages for local bird populations.

2. **Selective Tree Removal**: The project plans to implement minimal and highly selective tree removal. The aim is to ensure that the overall impact on vegetation communities, especially those areas utilized by wildlife, is kept to a minimum. This approach helps preserve habitats essential for various species during the stabilization works.

3. **Monitoring and Reporting**: The project includes commitments to monitoring wildlife post-construction to assess any indirect impacts and ensure that mitigation measures are effective. Any species at risk identified during ecological assessments or post-construction surveys would trigger further protective actions.

4. **Buffer Zones**: Establishing buffer zones around sensitive ecological areas is often recommended to reduce disturbances. This may include maintaining undisturbed areas directly adjacent to sensitive habitats.

These measures align with general best practices recognized in environmental assessments, particularly concerning projects that could potentially impact wildlife and their habitats.
