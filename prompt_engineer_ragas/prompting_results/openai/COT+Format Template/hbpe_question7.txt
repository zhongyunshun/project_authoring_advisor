The selection of erosion control structures in the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief" was based on a combination of effectiveness in addressing erosion concerns and their environmental impact. Key structures considered include armourstone headlands and gravel beaches, each chosen for their specific roles in shoreline stabilization.

1. **Armourstone Headlands**: The eastern and western armourstone headlands were specifically evaluated for their stability and condition. For instance, it was noted that the eastern armourstone headland (WF11.12) displayed visible displacement of material and backshore erosion, indicating a need for repairs. The effectiveness of these structures lies in their ability to absorb wave energy, reducing erosion along the shoreline.

2. **Gravel/Cobble Beaches**: The concept design for the gravel/rubble beach (WF11.11) was geared towards enhancing park user experience while mitigating erosion. This structure allows for better natural aesthetics and provides a more user-friendly environment. However, issues such as slumping and undercutting have been documented, suggesting that while effective, additional material may be necessary for better performance.

3. **Environmental Considerations**: The designs have been influenced by environmental factors, such as the local ecosystem and recreational use of the park. The documents indicate a preference for smaller cobble sizes on beaches to enhance user experience while balancing materials needed for effective erosion control.

Overall, the concepts aim to create a robust shoreline protection strategy that not only addresses immediate erosion issues but also considers long-term environmental sustainability and user accessibility.
