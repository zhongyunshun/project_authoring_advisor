To address your query about how specified tree removals and restoration plantings in projects like the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project contribute to or mitigate against biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk like bats and butternut trees, I refer to the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) documents.

### Contributions to Biodiversity and Mitigation

1. **Minimization of Tree Removals**: The project emphasizes minimal and highly selective tree removals, which aims to ensure that there is no significant overall impact on vegetation communities. This practice is crucial for maintaining habitat for various species, including the at-risk butternut trees, which are protected under Ontarioâ€™s Endangered Species Act (Document 1).

2. **Restoration Plantings**: The restoration efforts involve planting native species that are suitable for the area, which contributes to increased soil stabilization and enhances biodiversity once established. This approach aims to recover and promote ecological functionality in the disturbed areas. The planted vegetation not only helps in soil stabilization but also reinstates habitat for local wildlife (Document 6).

3. **Impact Mitigation on Species at Risk**: Specific references to butternut trees indicate that retaining these trees whenever possible aligns with conservation efforts for species at risk. The reports also highlight tree preservation plans that consider the ecological importance of these trees, further supporting biodiversity (Document 21).

4. **Timing of Construction Activities**: The construction activities are planned to avoid the bird breeding season, minimizing impacts on avian populations, including bat species that may utilize the same habitats. This scheduling is critical to ensure that both breeding birds and bats are not adversely affected during their sensitive periods (Document 13).

5. **Ecological Surveys**: Prior to any removals or construction, comprehensive biological surveys have been conducted to assess the presence of species at risk. This data guides decision-making regarding which trees and habitats need greater protection during construction (Document 20).

### Conclusion
The strategic approach of minimizing tree removals while implementing restoration initiatives enhances the local ecosystem's resilience. By focusing on native species and respecting the needs of species at risk like butternut trees and potentially affected bat populations, the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project aims to foster a more biodiverse and sustainable environment.
