Based on the "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final", the key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent included:

1. **Factor of Safety (FOS)**: The stabilization options were developed with a required Factor of Safety of 1.3, ensuring that the proposed solutions would effectively manage risk and ensure stability.

2. **Feasibility and Constructability**: The alternatives were assessed on their ability to be realistically implemented given the site's existing conditions and constraints.

3. **Environmental Impact**: The potential effects of each alternative on the surrounding environment and existing vegetation were considered, as minimizing ecological disruption was a priority.

4. **Cost Considerations**: Financial implications, including initial construction costs and long-term maintenance expenses, played a crucial role in the evaluation process.

5. **Draining Solutions**: Some alternatives provided more effective drainage management and stormwater runoff controls, which are vital in addressing erosion and slope stability.

6. **Community and Stakeholder Input**: Engagement with stakeholders during the public review period helped refine the preferred alternatives based on community concerns and preferences.

These factors were crucial in ensuring that the selected slope stabilization solution met technical, environmental, and social criteria effectively.
