The anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, as outlined in the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP," can be summarized based on several specific assessments and strategies proposed in the document.

### Environmental Impacts:
1. **Erosion and Slope Stability**: The project aims to address hazards related to valley slope erosion, which poses risks to human life and property. By stabilizing the slope, the project intends to reduce further erosion, thus protecting existing natural habitats and property.
   
2. **Impact on Wildlife and Vegetation**: The document notes that there are no significant wildlife populations or unique landforms within the Project limits that will be adversely affected. Although there are no expected significant impacts on wildlife, careful planning is necessary to minimize disturbances to existing vegetation during project implementation (Document 6, page 37; Document 9, page 28).

3. **Construction Impacts**: All construction activities are planned to minimize environmental disruption, particularly to existing natural habitats, thus limiting the potential adverse effects on local ecosystems (Document 18, page 26).

### Social Impacts:
1. **Public Engagement and Consultation**: The project has included public notification and consultation as a part of its environmental assessment process to inform and engage the local community about the projectâ€™s developments and milestones (Document 4, page 48).

2. **Safety and Property Protection**: By mitigating erosion hazards, the project directly addresses the safety of residents and their properties, which is a primary concern highlighted in the project objectives (Document 3, page 7; Document 5, page 3).

### Mitigation Strategies:
The "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" outlines several strategies to address these impacts:
- **Erosion Control Measures**: Structural stabilization techniques will be employed to ensure long-term durability and low maintenance of the slope, which will help in reducing the rate of erosion.
- **Minimizing Environmental Disruption**: Careful planning of construction activities aims to mitigate the impact on local ecosystems, and the consideration of alternative design approaches that involve less soil removal and impact to vegetation (Document 8, page 44).
- **Monitoring and Maintenance Plans**: Post-construction monitoring is proposed to ensure that the stabilization measures are effective and to make adjustments as necessary based on observed performance.

In conclusion, the project aims to balance the need for slope stabilization while addressing potential environmental and social impacts through comprehensive assessment and community engagement.
