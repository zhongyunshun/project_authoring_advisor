The future phases of the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project, as outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II," indicate that the project is being executed in three distinct phases. While specific details regarding the content of Phases II and III are referenced in the document, the overall approach emphasizes a comprehensive multi-year plan for shoreline maintenance.

- **Phase II** centers around the Western Headland and includes several specific scopes of work aimed at restoration and monitoring.
- **Phase III** is planned to follow Phase II and involves further construction efforts, particularly intended to enhance the retention of beach material as detailed in associated excavation plans.

For a comprehensive understanding, you may refer to the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" (source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, pages 4, 24, and 27).
