The roles and responsibilities of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and the City of Toronto in the maintenance and administration of Humber Bay Park East are typically outlined in project briefs and agreements related to the park's management. 

In the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I," TRCA is primarily responsible for the planning, design, and execution of maintenance projects within Humber Bay Park East. This includes analyzing environmental impacts, developing technical designs, and overseeing construction activities. Furthermore, TRCA collaborates with external partners and stakeholders, ensuring that project goals align with broader conservation and community objectives.

Conversely, the City of Toronto plays a role in the oversight and administrative support of the park's operations. This includes managing public access, ensuring safety, and facilitating community engagement in park usage. The city's involvement may also encompass funding initiatives and policy alignment to promote sustainable maintenance practices.

Together, TRCA and the City of Toronto aim to enhance the ecological integrity of Humber Bay Park East while ensuring it remains a valuable recreational space for the community.
