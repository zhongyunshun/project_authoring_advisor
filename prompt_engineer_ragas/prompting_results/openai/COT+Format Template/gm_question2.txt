To ensure the protection and minimal disruption of local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory for the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, several measures are being implemented:

1. **Aquatic Habitat Assessment and Monitoring**: A comprehensive aquatic inventory was conducted, which included monitoring the presence and health of aquatic species in the area. This inventory helps inform management strategies aimed at protecting local wildlife (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I, Page 19).

2. **Phased Implementation**: The project is structured in phases, with each phase designed to manage the impact on wildlife effectively. This approach allows for ongoing assessments and adjustments to minimize disturbances to the ecosystem, especially during critical periods for aquatic species (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase II, Page 4).

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Prior to the commencement of construction, measures such as silt barriers (silt socks) will be implemented to prevent sediment runoff into aquatic habitats, which could disrupt local species (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I, Page 32).

4. **Communication and Collaboration**: Ongoing discussions between the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), and other stakeholders are focusing on strategies for developing aquatic habitat and ensuring that disruption is minimized during construction activities (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I, Page 30).

5. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After the completion of phases, regular inspections will be carried out, especially after significant storm events, to assess the condition of aquatic habitats and make necessary management adjustments (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase II, Page 37).

These measures collectively aim to safeguard aquatic species and their habitats while allowing necessary maintenance activities within Humber Bay Park East. If you need more specific details or further clarifications, feel free to ask!
