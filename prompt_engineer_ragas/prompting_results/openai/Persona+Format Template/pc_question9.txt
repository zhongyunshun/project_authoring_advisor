Indigenous communities were actively engaged in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project through a structured consultation process. According to the documentation, a full record of the Indigenous community consultation, including copies of correspondence, is documented in the "Record of Indigenous Engagement for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project" found in Appendix D of the project plan (Document 1).

The consultations involved various Indigenous groups, including:
- Beausoleil First Nation
- Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation
- Chippewas of Rama-Mnjikaning First Nation
- Huron-Wendat Nation (Document 3).

In terms of outcomes, the engagement process facilitated discussions of concerns raised by these communities and helped ensure that their perspectives were considered in the projectâ€™s planning stages. Specific concerns discussed included the potential impacts of the project, though the detailed results of this engagement are primarily reflected in the public notifications and consultation that occurred throughout the Class Environmental Assessment (Class EA) process (Document 2). 

Overall, the engagement aimed to ensure transparency and foster a collaborative approach in addressing the concerns of Indigenous communities related to the project (Document 1).
