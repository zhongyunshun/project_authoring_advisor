The specific roles of various stakeholders in the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project are as follows:

1. **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA)**:
   - TRCA is the primary agency responsible for planning and executing the sanitary infrastructure protection works. They are in partnership with York Region to address erosion issues affecting German Mills Creek within the park.
   - TRCA oversees the environmental assessment process as part of the Municipal Class Environmental Assessment (MCEA) to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and public consultation.

2. **Local Municipalities (York Region)**:
   - York Region collaborates with TRCA to provide regional resources and support for the project. They are involved in overseeing the local environmental services and ensuring that the community's needs are met during the project implementation.

3. **Engineering Firms (e.g., Greck and Associates Limited)**:
   - Engineering firms are contracted to conduct detailed assessments, evaluations of alternatives, and technical designs for sanitation infrastructure. They perform fieldwork, data analysis, and the development of engineering reports to ensure the project adheres to safety and environmental standards.

4. **Community Stakeholders**:
   - Local residents and interest groups may also be involved through consultation processes, providing input on project impacts and desired outcomes for the park's ecosystem and recreational use.

The collaborative effort among these stakeholders is critical to navigating the complex challenges of environmental protection, public safety, and infrastructure needs in the German Mills Settlers Park area (Sources: Various documents related to the project, notably the German Mills â€“ Project File with Appendices).
