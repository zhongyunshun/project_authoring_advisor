The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project includes several measures aimed at protecting local wildlife, specifically aquatic species, during the execution of the project. Here are some key aspects:

1. **Baseline Inventory and Monitoring**: Before the project commenced, a comprehensive baseline inventory of aquatic species and habitats was conducted. This included assessments of fish populations and other aquatic organisms, which are critical for understanding the local ecosystem and informing conservation efforts (Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project: Phase I, page 19).

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: The project includes specific erosion and sediment control measures to minimize disturbances to aquatic habitats. This involves isolating staging and stockpiling areas with standard silt socks to prevent sediment from impacting water quality in adjacent habitats (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I, page 32).

3. **Collaboration with Regulatory Bodies**: The TRCA is working in conjunction with various stakeholders, including the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), to ensure that aquatic habitat alterations are kept to a minimum. Discussions are ongoing concerning the development of aquatic habitats that benefit local species (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I, page 30).

4. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After the project has been completed, there will be post-construction inspections and monitoring of the site during significant storm events and annually thereafter. This monitoring is crucial to assess the impact on aquatic species and to implement any additional measures if needed (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II, page 37).

These measures are part of a larger commitment to both habitat preservation and compliance with environmental standards, ensuring that local wildlife, particularly aquatic species, is protected throughout the maintenance project.
