In the development and implementation of TRCA projects, such as those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay, local Indigenous communities are consulted and involved through various engagement processes. 

For the Peacham Crescent project, the TRCA recognized the importance of Indigenous engagement, which is intended to allow communities to share their views and experiences. Consultation includes notifying Indigenous groups about project intentions, allowing for a range of communication methods depending on the community and the project's scope. The TRCA detailed a process that included a "Notice of Intent" and opportunities for further discussions (Document 17, page 50). Specifically, communities such as the Beausoleil First Nation, Chippewas of Georgina Island, and Six Nations of the Grand River were among those engaged (Document 7, page 292).

At Humber Bay, the TRCA applies similar principles, focusing on building sustainable community partnerships while adapting its policies to reflect the unique characteristics of its watersheds (Document 4, page 584). The TRCA strives to develop positive relationships with Aboriginal communities, ensuring that their interests are recognized and integrated into planning and environmental assessments (Document 11, page 576). 

Engagement methodologies may vary based on local practices and the project's specific concerns, but the overarching goal remains consistent: to foster meaningful participation from Indigenous communities in projects affecting their traditional territories and rights (Document 3, page 49).

These approaches are not static; TRCA's Indigenous Engagement guidelines are regularly updated to accommodate evolving community needs and legislative requirements.
