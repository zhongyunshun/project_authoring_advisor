The roles and responsibilities between the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and the City of Toronto regarding the maintenance and administration of Humber Bay Park East are outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I." 

The TRCA is primarily responsible for the technical aspects of the project, including the planning, design, and execution of shoreline maintenance activities. This includes assessing site conditions, conducting environmental impact assessments, and developing maintenance strategies for the park's infrastructure and natural habitats.

Conversely, the City of Toronto is responsible for the overarching management and administrative oversight of the park. This includes ensuring that the park remains accessible and safe for the public, collaborating with TRCA on community engagement efforts, and managing the park's day-to-day operations.

Both parties work collaboratively to ensure the sustainability and ecological integrity of Humber Bay Park East while addressing the needs of the community and local ecosystem (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I).
