The "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" outlines several anticipated environmental and social impacts associated with the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project and proposes measures to address them.

### Anticipated Environmental Impacts:
1. **Vegetation:** There is a concern regarding potential impacts on existing vegetation during construction activities; however, it is noted that all activities are planned to minimize these impacts (Document 18, p. 26).
2. **Wildlife:** The assessment indicates no significant wildlife populations within the project limits, therefore, no anticipated impacts on wildlife are expected (Document 9, p. 28).
3. **Riparian Uses:** No significant riparian uses were identified, suggesting that there will be no impacts resulting from the proposed works (Document 13, p. 29).
4. **Historic Canals and Unique Landforms:** There are no historic canals or unique landforms identified in the vicinity of the project, which reduces the likelihood of negative impacts on these features (Documents 22, p. 30 and 10, p. 23).

### Anticipated Social Impacts:
1. **Public Safety and Property Protection:** The primary aim of the project is to enhance the safety of human life and protect property from the hazards of valley slope erosion. The project plans to institute long-term, low-maintenance protective measures (Document 3, p. 7).
2. **Public Consultation:** The project follows a Class EA process that includes public notifications and consultations as a means to address community concerns and incorporate public input (Document 4, p. 48).

### Proposed Mitigation Measures:
The Class EA Plan proposes a range of actions aimed at minimizing the identified impacts:
- Implementation of construction practices that reduce soil removal and disturbances to existing vegetation (Document 8, p. 44).
- Construction activities will be limited to the upper valley slope to avoid riverine works, thereby mitigating impacts on aquatic environments (Document 16, p. 15).
- Ongoing maintenance costs and measures are also outlined, ensuring the proposed structure's longevity and effectiveness in preventing erosion (Document 11, p. 42).

These mitigation measures indicate TRCA's commitment to addressing the environmental and social impacts while prioritizing public safety and ecological integrity.
