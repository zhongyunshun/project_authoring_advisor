The decision-making process behind selecting specific erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches, involves several factors, primarily their effectiveness in preventing erosion, their environmental impacts, and the overall stability they provide to the shoreline.

1. **Effectiveness of Structures**:
   - **Armourstone Headlands**: These are chosen for their stability and ability to withstand strong wave action. The design and sizing of armour stones typically use the Hudson equation to ensure they are sufficient for the specific coastal conditions. For example, the placement of new armourstone over existing profiles is used to elevate shorelines and minimize erosion, as seen in areas where ongoing erosion and instability have been identified (Document 12 and 15).
   - **Cobble/Rubble Beaches**: While smaller cobble sizes provide a more user-friendly environment for beachgoers, they require more material to effectively protect the shoreline. The decision to incorporate them considers user experience alongside functional efficacy in erosion control (Document 3).

2. **Environmental Impact**:
   - The placement of structures like armourstone is typically done with minimal disturbance to existing coastal processes. For instance, recent projects have ensured that new revetment structures are placed on the same footprint as existing ones, thereby minimizing the impact on local ecosystems (Document 1).
   - Additionally, the TRCA considers the long-term maintenance needs and ecological functions of these structures, such as creating habitats. For example, recommendations included using surplus material from excavations to support wildlife habitats in the aquatic ecosystem (Document 20).

3. **Consultative Approach**:
   - The decision-making also involves consultations with TRCA staff to discuss options that balance structural integrity with minimal environmental disruption. For example, one option was to reinforce existing structures with additional armour stones instead of complete removal, thus reducing the overall disturbance to the shoreline (Document 22).

4. **Specific Projects**:
   - In the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, specific alternatives were considered for the revetment portions of the shoreline, weighing options of complete rebuilds against more conservative reinforcement methods, again emphasizing the importance of coastal stability and environmental health (Document 10).

Overall, the selection of erosion control structures hinges on a balance of functionality, user experience, environmental stewardship, and collaborative decision-making among experts.
