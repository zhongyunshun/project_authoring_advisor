The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation. Key practices include:

1. **Erosion Control**: The project addresses significant erosion concerns by enhancing the park's shoreline to withstand wave overtopping and other environmental stresses. This includes the careful planning of structures to mitigate future erosion risks (Source: Document 6).

2. **Restoration Plantings**: For site restoration, the project emphasizes regrading and seeding as part of its approach to restoring the natural environment. Such initiatives aim to improve habitat and enhance biodiversity within the park ecosystem (Source: Document 22).

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Following construction, there will be ongoing post-construction monitoring. This includes inspections conducted during the first year post-major storm events and annual checks thereafter to ensure the integrity of the work and continued environmental protection (Sources: Document 12 and Document 18).

4. **Climate Adaptation**: The project considers the impacts of climate change, planning for resilience against future climate-related events, especially those influencing lake levels and coastal conditions (Source: Document 14).

These practices not only aim at immediate infrastructure improvements but also contribute to the long-term ecological health and resilience of the Humber Bay Park East area, ensuring it remains a valued environmental asset for the community.
