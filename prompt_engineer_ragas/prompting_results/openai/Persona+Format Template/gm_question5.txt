The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is organized into three distinct phases for design and implementation. While the retrieved documents do not explicitly outline future phases beyond the initial phases of the project, the concept of a phased approach inherently indicates the possibility of future expansions or continued efforts, especially in response to ongoing erosion concerns and maintenance needs. 

On the other hand, the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project details current assessments but does not provide information on future phases or expansions. 

If you require more specific details about future expansions or potential subsequent phases for either project, please clarify or specify the project of interest.
