The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity by specifically mentioning measures related to bat species and butternut trees, both of which are of ecological concern in the project area.

1. **Bat Species**: The project documentation acknowledges the presence of bat habitat within the area. It states that appropriate compensation measures for any impacts on bat species will be coordinated during the construction activities to ensure minimal disruption to these populations (Document 8, page 10).

2. **Butternut Trees**: The project recognizes the presence of a Category 2 butternut tree within the project area, emphasizing its status as an endangered species protected under Ontarioâ€™s Endangered Species Act. The documents outline that tree removals will be minimal and highly selective to mitigate overall impacts on the welfare of the vegetation (Document 1, page 11; Document 19, page 26). There are also considerations to ensure compliance with relevant regulations regarding the protection of butternut trees (Document 11, page 10).

Overall, the project brief indicates a commitment to biodiversity conservation by planning construction activities in a manner that limits damage to ecological communities and conforms to legal protections for species at risk.
