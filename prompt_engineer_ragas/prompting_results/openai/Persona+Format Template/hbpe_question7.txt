The selection of erosion control structures in the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief" was guided by a combination of effectiveness in addressing erosion concerns and consideration of environmental impacts. The project emphasizes the following elements in the choice of structures:

1. **Structural Effectiveness**: The condition and structural stability of existing erosion control structures such as armourstone headlands and gravel beaches are assessed. For example, the document mentions the identified issues such as "visible displacement of material" and "backshore erosion" associated with the eastern armourstone headland (WF11.12) as critical factors leading to the selection of mitigation strategies (Document 2, page 11).

2. **Environmental Considerations**: The designs aimed to mitigate flooding risks while ensuring a user-friendly environment. Smaller cobble sizes were preferred for their ability to provide a comfortable beach experience, although they require more materials for adequate protection (Document 11, page 20). This balance serves to protect both human activity and local ecosystems.

3. **Adaptive Management**: Concepts designed for the maintenance of structures address specific concerns like low crest elevation and wave overtopping, ensuring they remain effective under varying lake levels. The proposed designs included creating berms with armourstone at transition points to reinforce the shoreline and manage drainage efficiently (Document 5, page 15; Document 8, page 17).

4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: The project reflects on the need for ongoing inspection and maintenance of erosion control structures to evaluate their effectiveness over time and adapt strategies as environmental conditions change (Document 20, page 9).

In summary, the choice of erosion control structures in the Humber Bay Park East project was rooted in both empirical assessments of existing conditions and a strategic approach to enhance resilience and environmental sustainability. For detailed condition assessments, you can refer to documents describing specific structures (Documents 2, 3, and 11).
