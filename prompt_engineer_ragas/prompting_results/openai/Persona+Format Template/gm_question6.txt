The erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park is designed not only to safeguard the infrastructure but also to mitigate potential social impacts, such as access to parklands and community recreational spaces. The German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project aims to ensure public safety while preserving the ecological integrity and accessibility of the park.

Key aspects include:

1. **Public Safety Considerations**: The project acknowledges the potential risks posed to trail and park users due to erosion. Implementing safety features, such as safety fences, is a part of the design alternatives evaluated to ensure that public safety is prioritized (Source: German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 40).

2. **Enhancement of Recreational Spaces**: The management plan includes efforts to enhance both terrestrial and aquatic habitats while preserving public enjoyment of the park. This dual objective recognizes the importance of recreational access alongside environmental protection (Source: German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 371).

3. **Long-term Infrastructure Solutions**: By providing long-term solutions for the protection of sanitary infrastructure and ensuring that stormwater and trail infrastructure are not adversely affected, the project aims to maintain the functionality and accessibility of park spaces for community use (Source: 2021-02-24 Project Brief_90 percent.pdf, page 9).

4. **Community Engagement**: The project has involved partnerships with local authorities, emphasizing a commitment to addressing community needs and maintaining access to recreational spaces throughout the infrastructure protection efforts (Source: German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 347).

In summary, the erosion hazard management strategies focus on balancing infrastructure protection with community recreational needs, ensuring safe, sustainable access to parklands while addressing the risks associated with erosion.
