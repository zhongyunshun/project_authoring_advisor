The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" include:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will undergo inspections during the first year following major storm events and will be inspected annually thereafter. This is crucial to ensure the efficacy of the erosion control measures and to address any issues that may arise (Document 1, page 36).

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Measures will be implemented prior to and maintained during construction phases, aiming to prevent sediment entry into water bodies. These strategies may need adjustments based on site conditions to effectively minimize sediment-laden runoff (Document 5, page 4; Document 6, page 4).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring by trained professionals during the construction phase will be conducted to ensure best management practices are being followed. If any erosion and sediment control measures are found to be ineffective, they will be repaired or modified as required (Document 15, page 45).

4. **Post-Construction Erosion Monitoring**: This includes a record of photographs and assessments to document the condition of the erosion control structures and the overall effectiveness of the implemented measures (Document 7, page 5).

By following these strategies, the TRCA aims to mitigate future erosion concerns and enhance the stability of the shoreline in the project area.
