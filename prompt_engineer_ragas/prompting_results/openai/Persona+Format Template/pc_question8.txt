The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" outlines several long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies to ensure the durability and effectiveness of the implemented slope stabilization measures. Key recommendations include:

1. **Periodic Maintenance of Vegetation**: There is an emphasis on the importance of maintaining vegetation during the initial years after stabilization. This involves regularly assessing the condition and health of the planted vegetation to ensure it becomes well-established and effectively contributes to slope stability.

2. **Monitoring of the Stabilization Structures**: Routine inspections of the mechanized stabilization structures (e.g., Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) structures) are essential. This includes checking for any signs of deterioration or unforeseen issues that may arise due to environmental factors.

3. **Assessment of Erosion Control Measures**: Ongoing evaluation of the erosion control measures implemented as part of the project helps in identifying any necessary adjustments or repairs that may be needed over time.

These strategies help in maintaining the effectiveness of the erosion control measures and contribute to the long-term stability of the slope (Source: "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief", pages 13 and 10).
