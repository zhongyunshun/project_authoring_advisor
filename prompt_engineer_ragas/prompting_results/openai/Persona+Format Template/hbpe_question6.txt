The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project addresses potential social impacts and the safety of the local community through several key measures. The assessment recognizes the risk of slope failure behind residential properties (specifically at 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent) and emphasizes the need to mitigate these risks to protect human life and property. The project includes stakeholder engagement as part of its Class Environmental Assessment process, which involves notifying the public and consulting with local residents about project developments (Document 21, page 11; Document 18, page 48).

Furthermore, the project aims to minimize disturbances during construction by using erosion and sediment control measures while isolating the work area with fencing to prevent the entry of harmful materials (Document 13, page 15). By addressing both the environmental risks and engaging the community, the project strives to ensure both safety and social equity for local residents. 

For further details, you may refer to the project documents, specifically the Class EA Project Plan which outlines objectives and public consultation measures (Document 21, pages 11-12; Document 18, page 48).
