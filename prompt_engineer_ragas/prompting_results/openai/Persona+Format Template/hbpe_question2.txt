The shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" significantly consider the impacts on local wildlife, particularly aquatic species. The project aims to protect and enhance aquatic habitats, as indicated in the baseline inventory sections of the relevant documents.

1. **Habitat Alteration**: The project involves various construction activities that may lead to habitat alteration. While the project does not include in-water work, consideration is given to the potential impacts on fish habitats as a result of structural changes. The goal includes minimizing adverse effects and promoting habitat restoration (Design Brief - Phase II, page 25).

2. **Aquatic Species Inventory**: Specific aquatic species were noted in the project briefs. For example, a summary of the aquatic species documented includes the Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax), which is recorded as native/introduced, and the Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus), identified as invasive (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II, page 18). The planning stages included assessments and discussions on these species to ensure their habitats are preserved during the maintenance work.

3. **Mitigation Measures**: To ensure the conservation of these species, the project outlines ongoing collaboration among TRCA, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), and other stakeholders. This collaboration is crucial for developing aquatic habitat improvements and mitigating any negative impacts from the maintenance activities (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I, page 30).

4. **Restoration and Compensation Plantings**: In an attempt to counterbalance any habitat disruption, a preliminary planting plan including compensation plantings is proposed. A total of 152 on-site compensation plantings are planned to mitigate the project's effects (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II, page 36).

In conclusion, the Humber Bay Park East shoreline maintenance projects are designed with a focus on minimizing impacts to local wildlife, employing strategies for maintaining and enhancing aquatic habitats while accounting for existing species in the area.
