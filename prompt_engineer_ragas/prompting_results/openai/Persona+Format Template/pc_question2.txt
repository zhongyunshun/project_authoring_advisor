In the context of the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, specific measures proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, particularly concerning species identified in the vicinity, include:

1. **Minimizing Habitat Disruption**: The project plans to have minimal and highly selective removal of vegetation, which is intended to avoid significant impacts on local wildlife and vegetation communities. This strategy aims to preserve the existing natural habitat within the project limits (Document 3, page 26).

2. **Timing of Construction Activities**: To protect breeding birds, construction activities are scheduled to occur outside the bird breeding window. This approach is designed to minimize potential disturbances to bird habitat and ensure the safety of breeding activities (Document 18, page 27).

3. **Use of Sediment Control Measures**: Standard sediment control fencing will be utilized prior to the start of construction to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the surrounding environment, thereby protecting local ecosystems (Document 8, page 15).

4. **Consultation and Notification**: The project follows a Class Environmental Assessment process that includes public notifications and consultation, ensuring that the local community and stakeholders have a voice in the decision-making process (Document 17, page 48).

5. **Arborist Report Reference**: For comprehensive details on tree inventory and proposed removals, stakeholders are directed to refer to TRCA's Arborist Report and Tree Preservation Plan, which contains specific guidelines for protecting species at risk during the project (Document 6, page 10).

These measures collectively aim to reduce impacts on local wildlife and preserve the ecological integrity of the area throughout the project's implementation.
