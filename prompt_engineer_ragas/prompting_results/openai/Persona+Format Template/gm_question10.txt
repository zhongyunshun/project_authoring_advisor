The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project incorporates tree removals and restoration plantings that play a significant role in mitigating biodiversity loss, particularly in relation to species at risk, such as the butternut tree and potentially bats in the area.

1. **Tree Removals**: The project specifies that tree removals will be minimal and highly selective to limit the overall impact on existing vegetation. This careful approach helps to maintain the ecological integrity of the area, thereby supporting the habitat needs of species at risk like the butternut, which is classified as endangered in Ontario and protected under the Endangered Species Act (Document 1, page 27; Document 2, page 11).

2. **Restoration Plantings**: The project aims to implement restoration plantings of suitable native species to enhance soil stabilization and promote biodiversity once established. These restorations are designed to revive local ecosystems, providing habitat and food sources for various species, including bats. Increased plant biodiversity can also strengthen the resilience of ecosystems against invasive species and habitat degradation (Document 6, page 40; Document 18, page 38).

3. **Impact Mitigation**: Specific construction activities are timed to avoid critical periods for breeding and foraging, which helps prevent disturbances to wildlife, including bats. The project's design includes measures to ensure that impacts during construction are minimized and that post-construction activities include replanting and habitat recovery, which should ultimately benefit species at risk (Document 13, page 27; Document 14, page 16).

In summary, the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project integrates strategic tree removals with active restoration efforts, thereby contributing positively to local biodiversity and offering crucial support for threatened species like the butternut and potentially benefiting bat populations through improved habitat conditions.
