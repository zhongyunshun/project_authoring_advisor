The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the erosion control measures installed in projects like the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project include regular inspections of the site. Specifically, the site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter to ensure that the erosion control measures are functioning as expected (Source: Document 1, HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 36; Document 2, HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 37). 

Additionally, there are provisions for restoration plantings, which may involve activities such as regrading and seeding to support the restoration of the site conditions post-construction (Source: Document 17, HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 34).
