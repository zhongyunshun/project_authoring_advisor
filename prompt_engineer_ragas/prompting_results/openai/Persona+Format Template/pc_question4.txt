The roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the Class Environmental Assessment (Class EA) for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project are generally outlined within the context of the Class EA process, although specific details might not be elaborately detailed in the retrieved documents. However, key elements related to stakeholder engagement and responsibilities can be inferred. Hereâ€™s a summary based on the available information:

1. **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA)**: As the lead organization, TRCA is responsible for overseeing the entire Class EA process. This includes conducting public consultations, coordinating assessments, and making decisions on project implementation and design.

2. **Public Participants**: Stakeholders such as local residents and community groups are involved through public notifications and consultations, which are part of the Class EA process. Their feedback is usually gathered to address community concerns and interests related to the project (Document 3).

3. **Environmental Specialists and Consultants**: These professionals are engaged to conduct environmental assessments, including evaluating potential effects and recommending mitigation strategies based on the findings (Documents 5, 17, and 21). They are critical in providing scientific insights that inform the EA recommendations and project design.

4. **Regulatory Authorities**: They may be involved in the review process to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and guidelines, including potential referrals to the Minister of the Environment when specific thresholds are met (Document 9).

5. **Decision-Makers**: Ultimately, TRCA and relevant regulatory bodies are responsible for the final approval of the project, ensuring that all stakeholder concerns are addressed, and that the project meets environmental standards and public safety requirements (Document 21).

For specific details on these roles and any additional stakeholders involved, the document might provide more explicit information on stakeholder engagement strategies and consultation outcomes.
