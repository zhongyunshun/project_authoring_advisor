The selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives for the project behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent was influenced by several key factors as outlined in the "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final." These factors included:

1. **Geotechnical Considerations**: The slope stabilization solutions were based on geotechnical assessments, ensuring that the selected alternative provided adequate stability. A specific Factor of Safety (FOS) of 1.3 was requested, guiding the design considerations and alternatives offered (Document 9).

2. **Environmental Impact**: The evaluation of alternatives included a detailed environmental analysis to minimize impacts on existing vegetation and ecosystems. The chosen alternatives aimed to balance effective stabilization with ecological preservation (Document 4).

3. **Feasibility and Constructability**: The practicality of implementing each alternative was a crucial factor. The alternatives were assessed based on their feasibility and the potential challenges associated with their construction (Document 17).

4. **Cost Effectiveness**: Financial implications played a significant role in the selection process. The alternatives were examined for their cost estimates and overall affordability, ensuring that the preferred solution fit within the project's budgetary constraints (Document 5).

5. **Stakeholder Feedback**: The results of the evaluation were subject to a stakeholder and public review process, ensuring that community concerns were addressed and considered in the final decision (Document 11).

The culmination of these factors led to the identification of the Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) Structure as the preferred solution for slope stabilization efforts in the project area.
