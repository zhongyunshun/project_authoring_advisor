The future phases planned for the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project, as mentioned in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II," include three distinct phases of design and implementation. Each phase has been structured to address various aspects of the shoreline maintenance efforts over several years. Here are some details regarding these phases:

1. **Phase I**: This involved initial site setup and early construction works aimed at enhancing the eastern headland.

2. **Phase II**: Currently underway, this phase focuses on the western headland, involving more extensive shoreline maintenance and restoration activities.

3. **Phase III**: Planned as a subsequent phase, it is intended to further enhance and expand the shoreline restoration efforts, including activities that may involve the placement of beach material.

The phased approach allows for systematic implementation, monitoring, and adjustment of strategies as necessary throughout the project's lifespan.
