The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several measures to protect local wildlife, particularly aquatic species. These measures may include:

1. **Environmental Assessments**: Conducting thorough environmental impact assessments to identify and evaluate potential impacts on local wildlife and aquatic habitats.

2. **Timing Restrictions**: Implementing seasonal restrictions on construction activities to avoid critical breeding or nesting periods for local wildlife.

3. **Buffer Zones**: Establishing buffer zones around sensitive habitats to minimize disturbance from construction activities.

4. **Technology and Techniques**: Using sound construction techniques that reduce noise and vibrations harmful to aquatic species, such as quieter machinery or methods to limit water turbidity.

5. **Habitat Preservation**: Avoiding or minimizing the removal of key habitats and vegetation that provide shelter and breeding grounds for aquatic species.

6. **Wildlife Monitoring**: Setting up a monitoring program to track the health and activity of local wildlife during and after the project.

7. **Public Awareness and Education**: Engaging the community and stakeholders through information sessions to highlight the importance of protecting local ecosystems.

8. **Collaboration with Environmental Agencies**: Working closely with environmental organizations and regulatory bodies to ensure compliance with wildlife protection regulations.

These strategies aim to balance the maintenance objectives of the project with the conservation of local wildlife populations and their habitats. For specific details on the measures involved, consulting project documentation or local governing bodies would provide the most accurate information.
