When it comes to projects involving local Indigenous communities, it is vital to have specific engagements or consultations throughout both the planning and implementation phases. Engaging with Indigenous communities often includes:

1. **Initial Consultations**: Early meetings to discuss project proposals, gather input, and establish a relationship. This is often where the project's intent and potential impacts on Indigenous lands and cultures are presented.

2. **Impact Assessments**: Collaboration with Indigenous communities during environmental and social impact assessments to evaluate how the project might affect their rights, lands, and resources. 

3. **Ongoing Communication**: Regular updates and meetings throughout the project's lifespan to ensure transparency, share progress, and address concerns raised by the community.

4. **Co-Management Agreements**: In some cases, projects may involve formal agreements where Indigenous communities have a role in decision-making and management of resources.

5. **Cultural Sensitivity Training**: Providing project staff with training on Indigenous history, rights, and culture as part of engagement efforts.

6. **Capacity Building**: Supporting skill development within the Indigenous community to ensure they can meaningfully participate in the project.

7. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Involvement of Indigenous voices in monitoring the project's progress and evaluating its impacts over time.

Specific instances or detailed documentation regarding these engagements would typically be found in project proposals, environmental assessments, or community reports associated with the particular projects in question.
