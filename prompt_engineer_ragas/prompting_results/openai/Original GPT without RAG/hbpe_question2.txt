To provide a detailed answer regarding the impact of the shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" on local wildlife, particularly aquatic species, a careful analysis of the project's specifics and its baseline inventory section is necessary. Since I do not have access to that document, I can outline some general potential impacts based on common shoreline maintenance practices and their effects on aquatic ecosystems.

1. **Habitat Alteration**: Shoreline maintenance often involves the alteration of habitats. This can disrupt existing ecological balances, especially for species that rely on specific conditions for breeding, feeding, or shelter. 

2. **Water Quality**: Activities such as dredging, the use of heavy machinery, or the introduction of construction materials can lead to increased turbidity and sedimentation in the water, affecting photosynthesis in aquatic plants and disrupting the habitat for fish and other aquatic life.

3. **Species Displacement**: The maintenance work could lead to the displacement of local species, particularly if the work occurs during crucial breeding or migratory periods. Aquatic species that are sensitive to disturbances may move away from the area, impacting their population dynamics.

4. **Chemical Runoff**: If maintenance activities involve the use of chemicals (e.g., herbicides or pesticides), there is a risk of runoff into the water system, which could harm aquatic species, including fish and invertebrates.

5. **Habitat Restoration**: On the positive side, if the maintenance project includes elements of habitat restoration, this could enhance or create better environments for aquatic species, leading to potential population rebounds.

6. **Monitoring and Management**: Ongoing monitoring as part of the project could help mitigate impacts by allowing for adaptive management strategies if negative effects on wildlife are observed.

To assess the specific impacts accurately, it is essential to compare these potential impacts against the baseline inventory section mentioned in the project brief and consider specific mitigation measures proposed within the project. For comprehensive insights, consulting the actual document or relevant environmental assessments would be necessary.
