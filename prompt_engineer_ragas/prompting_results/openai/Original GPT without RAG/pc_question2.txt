To provide an accurate response, I would need to review the specific findings of the Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project. However, I can outline general measures commonly proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, particularly for projects involving erosion control and slope stabilization:

1. **Habitat Preservation**: Identify and protect critical habitats during construction by establishing buffer zones around sensitive areas.

2. **Timing of Construction**: Schedule construction activities during seasons that minimize disturbance to wildlife, particularly during breeding or nesting seasons.

3. **Wildlife Corridors**: Create or maintain wildlife corridors to facilitate safe movement for species across the project area.

4. **Erosion Control Techniques**: Utilize bioengineering methods (e.g., planting native vegetation) that not only stabilize soil but also provide habitat for local wildlife.

5. **Invasive Species Management**: Implement plans to manage and remove invasive plant species that may threaten local wildlife.

6. **Monitoring and Adaptive Management**: Establish a monitoring program to track the health of local species and adjust management plans based on observed impacts.

7. **Public Education and Involvement**: Engage the community in conservation efforts and educate them about the importance of local wildlife and habitats.

8. **Consultation with Wildlife Experts**: Work with ecologists or wildlife biologists to ensure that specific measures are tailored to the species present in the area.

If you have access to specific details from the memorandum, I could provide more targeted measures based on those findings.
