I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific documents or reports, including the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief." However, I can suggest common long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for slope stabilization measures:

1. **Regular Inspections**: Conduct periodic visual inspections of the slope and stabilization measures to identify signs of erosion, settlement, or structural failure.

2. **Instrumentation Monitoring**: Utilize instruments such as inclinometers, piezometers, and settlement gauges to monitor soil movement, groundwater levels, and any changes in slope stability.

3. **Vegetation Management**: Maintain vegetative cover on slopes to ensure soil stability. This may include replanting or reseeding as necessary, and managing invasive species that could compromise slope integrity.

4. **Drainage Management**: Regularly check and maintain drainage systems to prevent water accumulation that could lead to erosion or landslides. This may include cleaning out ditches, culverts, and drainage pipes.

5. **Repair and Maintenance of Erosion Control Measures**: Monitor the condition of erosion control installations such as retaining walls, gabions, or soil nails, and make repairs as needed.

6. **Public Awareness and Education**: Educate nearby residents or stakeholders about the importance of maintaining slope stability and encourage reporting of any concerns.

7. **Documentation and Reporting**: Keep detailed records of all inspections, findings, maintenance activities, and repairs to track changes over time and inform any necessary future actions.

For precise strategies from the specific document you referenced, I recommend reviewing that document directly or consulting an engineering professional familiar with slope stabilization practices.
