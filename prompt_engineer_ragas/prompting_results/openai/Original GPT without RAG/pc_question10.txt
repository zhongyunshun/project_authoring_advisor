I'm sorry, but I do not have access to specific documents such as the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief." However, I can provide general information on how project briefs often address biodiversity concerns, particularly regarding species like bats and butternut trees.

Typically, a project brief addressing biodiversity impacts might include:

1. **Baseline Studies**: An assessment of the existing biodiversity in the area, including surveys for bat populations and the presence of butternut trees.

2. **Impact Assessment**: A discussion of how construction or development activities might adversely affect bat habitats (such as roosting sites) and the health of butternut trees.

3. **Mitigation Strategies**: Recommendations for minimizing impacts, such as:
   - Timing construction to avoid key bat activity periods (e.g., breeding or hibernation seasons).
   - Preserving or creating buffers around butternut trees to protect their root zones.
   - Implementing protocols for monitoring bat activity and tree health during and after project implementation.

4. **Habitat Restoration**: Plans for restoring or enhancing habitats that may be affected, ensuring that any lost ecological functions are replaced.

5. **Ongoing Monitoring**: A commitment to monitor biodiversity-related impacts throughout the project's lifecycle, allowing for adaptive management practices if negative impacts are identified.

6. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involvement of local conservation groups, agencies, or Indigenous communities in decision-making processes related to biodiversity conservation.
