I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific documents such as the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II." To find information about future phases or expansions planned for Humber Bay Park East, I recommend checking local government websites, park management resources, or any recent news releases related to the park. You could also contact local city planning departments for the most accurate and detailed information.
