I'm sorry, but I don't have access to external documents, including "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final," and therefore cannot provide specific details or key factors from it. However, discussion of typical factors influencing the selection of slope stabilization alternatives generally includes considerations such as:

1. **Geotechnical Conditions**: Soil type, stability, and existing geological conditions.
2. **Cost**: Financial implications of various alternatives, including construction and maintenance costs.
3. **Environmental Impact**: Effects on local ecosystems, water drainage, and habitat preservation.
4. **Effectiveness**: Expected performance and longevity of the stabilization method.
5. **Ease of Construction**: Complexity of the construction process required for each alternative.
6. **Community Impact**: How the project impacts local residents and infrastructure.
7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to local, state, and federal regulations regarding construction and environmental protection.
