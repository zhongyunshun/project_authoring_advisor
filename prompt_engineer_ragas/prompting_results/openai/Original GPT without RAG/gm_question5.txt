I don't have access to specific ongoing projects or future plans for the Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent areas. For the latest information on erosion control and slope stabilization efforts, I recommend checking with local government agencies, parks departments, or community planning offices that manage these projects. They often provide updates on project phases and any planned expansions or additional efforts in specific areas.
