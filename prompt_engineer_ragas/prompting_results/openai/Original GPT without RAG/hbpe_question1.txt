I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific external documents, including "Design Brief - Phase II." To find specific details about engineering challenges and considerations for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East, I recommend reviewing the actual document or contacting the relevant authority or organization responsible for the project. If you have general questions about shoreline protection engineering, I can help with that!
