To provide a detailed answer, I need to clarify that I do not have access to specific documents such as the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP." However, I can outline common anticipated environmental and social impacts of slope stabilization projects and typical approaches used in Class Environmental Assessments (EAs) to address these impacts.

### Anticipated Environmental Impacts

1. **Erosion and Sedimentation**: Construction activities can disturb soil, leading to increased sedimentation in nearby water bodies.
2. **Habitat Disruption**: Wildlife habitats could be affected due to vegetation removal and alteration of the landscape.
3. **Water Quality**: Runoff from construction sites may contaminate local waterways with pollutants.
4. **Vegetation Removal**: Stabilization efforts may require the removal of plants that are crucial for local ecosystems.
5. **Changes in Drainage Patterns**: Alterations in slope stability can change natural drainage patterns, impacting local hydrology.

### Anticipated Social Impacts

1. **Community Disruption**: Construction noise and traffic can disrupt local communities.
2. **Aesthetics**: Changes to the landscape can affect the visual quality of the area, leading to concerns among residents about the project.
3. **Economic Impacts**: Construction may temporarily impact local businesses or property values.

### Addressing Impacts in Class EAs

In a Class EA context, such as the one likely presented in the "Peacham Class EA PP," several strategies are typically used to mitigate the identified impacts:

1. **Environmental Assessment Studies**: Conducting thorough assessments to understand how the project will affect the environment; public consultation can be part of this process to gather community input.
  
2. **Mitigation Measures**: Developing strategies to reduce adverse effects, such as:
   - **Erosion Control**: Implementing measures like silt fences and erosion control mats.
   - **Revegetation Plans**: Planning for the planting of native vegetation post-construction to restore habitats.
   - **Water Management Strategies**: Designing drainage systems that prevent water quality impacts.
  
3. **Monitoring Programs**: Establishing protocols for monitoring the environmental impact during and after construction to ensure compliance with mitigation measures.

4. **Community Engagement**: Involving stakeholders and the public throughout the project to address concerns, gather feedback, and ensure transparency.

5. **Adapting Recommendations**: Based on stakeholder feedback and monitoring results, adapting the project plans to minimize negative impacts further.
