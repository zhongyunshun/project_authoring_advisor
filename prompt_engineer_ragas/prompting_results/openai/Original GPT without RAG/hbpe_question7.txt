The "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief" details various erosion control structures, including armourstone headlands and gravel beaches. The selection of these structures was typically based on several key considerations:

1. **Effectiveness**: The primary function of any erosion control structure is to mitigate erosion effectively. The brief likely evaluated the capacity of each structure to withstand wave action and prevent the loss of shoreline. For example, armourstone headlands are robust and can provide significant protection against wave energy, making them effective in high-energy environments.

2. **Environmental Impact**: An important factor in the selection process is the environmental implications of each structure. The design aimed to minimize negative impacts on the ecosystem, including aquatic habitats and species. Gravel beaches, for instance, may be preferred in certain areas due to their ability to support local wildlife and maintain natural sediment transport processes, promoting better ecological integration.

3. **Site-Specific Conditions**: The geology, hydrology, and existing ecosystem at Humber Bay were likely assessed to determine the suitability of each structure. This includes considerations like wave height, sediment supply, and human activity in the area.

4. **Long-Term Sustainability**: The chosen structures are also assessed for their long-term sustainability. This involves evaluating maintenance needs, durability, and how the structures will evolve with changing environmental conditions over time.

5. **Community and Recreational Considerations**: The design also reflects community interests, balancing the need for erosion control with opportunities for recreational access and enjoyment of the natural environment.

The brief would provide a comprehensive understanding of how these factors were weighed to ensure that the erosion control strategies implemented are both functional and environmentally responsible.
