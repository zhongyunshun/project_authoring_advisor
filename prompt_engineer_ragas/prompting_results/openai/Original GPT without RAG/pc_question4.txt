I'm sorry, but I don’t have access to external documents or specific reports such as "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP." However, I can provide you with general information on the typical roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in a Class Environmental Assessment (EA) process.

In a Class Environmental Assessment, stakeholders often include:

1. **Project Proponents**: These are usually the agencies or organizations initiating the project. Their responsibilities include conducting the EA and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations.

2. **Regulatory Agencies**: Government bodies responsible for overseeing environmental compliance. They review the EA and provide approvals or permits needed for the project.

3. **Indigenous Groups**: Indigenous communities may have roles in consultation processes, particularly if the project affects their lands or rights. They may provide traditional ecological knowledge and concerns about the project’s impacts.

4. **Local Governments**: Municipal or regional governments may be involved to ensure that the project aligns with local policy, zoning, and community planning.

5. **Community Members**: Public stakeholders who may be affected by the project. They have the responsibility to engage in consultation and voicing their concerns or support during the EA process.

6. **Environmental Organizations**: NGOs and advocacy groups may provide research, raise awareness, and advocate for environmental protections during the project assessment.

7. **Consultants**: Experts hired by the project proponent or regulatory agencies to conduct technical studies and analyses required for the EA.

8. **The Public**: General public stakeholders who may participate in public meetings, provide comments during the consultation period, and contribute to discussions about potential impacts.

Each stakeholder's involvement will depend on the specific context of the project, local laws, and regulations, as well as the applicable Class EA processes. For detailed roles specific to the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, you would need to refer directly to the Class EA document or relevant resources.
