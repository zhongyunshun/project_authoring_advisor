The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation. While I don't have specific details on the current project implementation, sustainable development practices typically include the following:

1. **Ecosystem Restoration**: Enhancing natural habitats by restoring native plant species and improving biodiversity. This might involve removing invasive species and planting native flora to support local wildlife.

2. **Stormwater Management**: Implementing green infrastructure solutions such as bioswales, rain gardens, and permeable paving to manage rainwater runoff and reduce erosion, which helps to protect local waterways from pollution.

3. **Sustainable Materials**: Using environmentally friendly materials in construction and maintenance, such as recycled materials or sustainably sourced timber, to minimize the ecological footprint.

4. **Energy Efficiency**: Incorporating energy-efficient practices in park facilities, such as installing LED lighting and using solar energy where possible to reduce energy consumption.

5. **Waste Reduction**: Establishing efficient waste management practices to minimize waste generated during construction and operation, including recycling and composting programs.

6. **Community Engagement**: Involving the local community in decision-making processes and educational programs to raise awareness about sustainable practices and environmental stewardship.

7. **Water Conservation**: Using irrigation systems that conserve water, such as drip irrigation and drought-resistant landscaping, to promote water efficiency in the park's maintenance.

8. **Accessibility and Mobility**: Creating accessible pathways and encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, to reduce the carbon footprint associated with vehicle use.

9. **Monitoring and Assessment**: Establishing a monitoring system to assess the environmental impact of the project over time, and adapting management practices based on findings to ensure ongoing conservation efforts.

These practices support the overall goal of promoting environmental sustainability, enhancing the recreational value of the park, and ensuring that the natural environment is preserved for future generations. For the most accurate and specific practices related to the Humber Bay Park East project, it would be best to consult project documentation or local government sources.
