I donâ€™t have access to specific documents or their contents, including the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief." However, I can provide general guidance on how project briefs typically address biodiversity conservation, particularly concerning bat species and butternut trees.

1. **Impact Assessment**: A project brief usually includes an environmental impact assessment (EIA) that evaluates potential impacts on local biodiversity. This section may identify bat species present in the area and assess how the project could affect their habitats or migration patterns.

2. **Mitigation Strategies**: The document might outline strategies to mitigate negative impacts on bat populations, such as creating buffer zones, preserving roosting sites, or timing construction activities to avoid critical periods for bats, like breeding or migration seasons.

3. **Butternut Trees**: If butternut trees are present, the project brief may discuss their conservation status, as they are considered a species at risk in many regions. It may include measures to protect these trees, such as avoiding their removal, implementing tree protection zones, or replanting in suitable areas if removal is unavoidable.

4. **Monitoring and Reporting**: The project may propose a monitoring plan to track the health of bat populations and butternut trees during and after construction. This could involve regular surveys and reporting to ensure compliance with conservation goals.

5. **Public Consultation**: There may also be a section on stakeholder engagement, where the project team discusses how they will involve local communities and conservation groups in the planning and monitoring processes.

For specific insights from the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief," I recommend reviewing the document directly or consulting an expert in environmental assessments.
