To provide a comprehensive answer, I would need more context about the specific projects you are referring to. Generally, many projects that impact local Indigenous communities do include engagements or consultations as part of their planning and implementation phases. This is often done to ensure that the rights, interests, and cultural heritage of Indigenous peoples are respected and incorporated into the project planning.

Engagements may include:

1. **Initial Consultations**: Early discussions to inform Indigenous communities about the project and gather their feedback.
2. **Cultural Assessments**: Evaluating potential impacts on cultural sites and practices.
3. **Collaborative Planning**: Working with Indigenous leaders to co-develop project plans.
4. **Ongoing Communication**: Maintaining open lines of communication throughout the project lifecycle.
5. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establishing ways for communities to provide input or express concerns during and after implementation.

For specific details, it would be necessary to look at project documents, environmental assessments, or consultation reports that outline these engagements.
