Humber Bay Park East (HBPE) is a significant recreational area located in Toronto, and its maintenance and administration involves collaboration between the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and the City of Toronto. While I don't have access to specific documents or reports like the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I," I can provide a general overview of the typical roles and responsibilities of these two entities based on common practices in park management and conservation.

### Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA)
1. **Environmental Stewardship**: TRCA is primarily focused on environmental conservation and stewardship. This includes maintaining the ecological integrity of the park, managing natural habitats, and protecting local wildlife.

2. **Monitoring and Assessment**: The TRCA is responsible for monitoring the health of the ecosystems within the park. This includes assessing water quality, flora, and fauna, as well as implementing necessary conservation measures.

3. **Restoration Projects**: TRCA often leads restoration projects aimed at rehabilitating degraded areas within the park. This might involve planting native species, controlling invasive species, and restoring natural landscapes.

4. **Public Education and Outreach**: TRCA may also engage in public education initiatives to raise awareness about the importance of conservation, promote sustainable practices, and encourage community involvement in park activities.

5. **Collaboration with Other Agencies**: The TRCA collaborates with various stakeholders, including government agencies, community groups, and volunteer organizations, to enhance the park's management and conservation efforts.

### City of Toronto
1. **Park Maintenance and Operations**: The City of Toronto is typically responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of the park, including landscaping, cleaning, and the upkeep of facilities such as pathways, restrooms, and recreational amenities.

2. **Infrastructure Development**: The City may oversee the planning and development of new infrastructure within the park, such as picnic areas, signage, and recreational facilities, ensuring they align with community needs and environmental considerations.

3. **Programming and Events**: The City is often involved in organizing community events, recreational programs, and activities that take place in the park, fostering community engagement and promoting the park as a vibrant public space.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: The City ensures that all activities within the park comply with local bylaws, regulations, and environmental standards, working closely with the TRCA to meet conservation objectives.

5. **Community Engagement**: The City of Toronto typically engages with the local community to gather input on park management and improvements, facilitating public consultations and incorporating feedback into planning processes.

### Collaboration
Both TRCA and the City of Toronto work together to ensure that Humber Bay Park East meets the needs of the community while protecting its natural environment. Their partnership is essential for effective park management, combining conservation efforts with recreational opportunities for residents and visitors.
