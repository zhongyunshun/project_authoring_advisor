I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific documents or their contents, including the "Design Brief - Phase II" document you mentioned. However, I can provide general information on typical engineering challenges and considerations for shoreline protection projects. If you need specific details from that document, I would recommend reviewing it directly. Would you like me to summarize common challenges in shoreline protection design?
