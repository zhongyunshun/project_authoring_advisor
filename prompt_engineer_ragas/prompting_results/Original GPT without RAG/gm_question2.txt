The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project includes several measures aimed at protecting local wildlife, particularly aquatic species. These measures typically include:

1. **Baseline Inventory Assessment**: Conducting thorough baseline studies to identify and monitor the local wildlife, especially aquatic species, helps in understanding their habitats and behaviors.

2. **Timing of Works**: Scheduling construction activities to avoid critical periods for wildlife, such as breeding or migration seasons, to minimize disruption.

3. **Habitat Protection**: Implementing physical barriers or buffers around sensitive habitats to prevent disturbance during construction.

4. **Water Quality Management**: Ensuring that construction practices do not lead to runoff or pollution that could affect water quality and harm aquatic life.

5. **Erosion and Sediment Control**: Utilizing measures to control erosion and sedimentation during construction to protect aquatic habitats.

6. **Wildlife Monitoring**: Ongoing monitoring of wildlife populations during and after construction to assess impacts and adapt practices as needed.

7. **Community Engagement**: Involving local communities and stakeholders in planning and feedback processes to incorporate local knowledge and concerns regarding wildlife.

8. **Restoration Plans**: Developing and implementing restoration plans post-construction to rehabilitate any disturbed habitats and support the recovery of local wildlife populations.

These measures help ensure that the project proceeds with minimal impact on the local ecosystem and supports the conservation of aquatic species in Humber Bay Park East.
