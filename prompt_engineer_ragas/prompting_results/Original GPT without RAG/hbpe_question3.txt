The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation. These practices may include:

1. **Ecosystem Restoration**: Efforts to rehabilitate and restore natural habitats, including wetlands and native vegetation, to enhance biodiversity and improve ecosystem services.

2. **Stormwater Management**: Implementation of green infrastructure such as bioswales, permeable pavements, and rain gardens to manage stormwater runoff effectively, reduce flooding, and improve water quality.

3. **Sustainable Materials**: Use of environmentally friendly and sustainable materials in construction and maintenance processes to minimize the ecological footprint.

4. **Native Plant Landscaping**: Planting of native species that are adapted to the local climate and soil, which require less water and maintenance, and provide habitat for local wildlife.

5. **Energy Efficiency**: Incorporation of energy-efficient technologies and practices in park facilities, such as solar lighting and energy-efficient irrigation systems.

6. **Waste Management**: Implementation of recycling and composting programs to minimize waste generated during construction and ongoing park maintenance.

7. **Community Engagement**: Involving the local community in planning and maintenance efforts to raise awareness about sustainability and promote stewardship of the park.

8. **Monitoring and Research**: Establishing protocols for monitoring environmental impacts and conducting research to adaptively manage the parkâ€™s ecological health over time.

These practices collectively contribute to the long-term sustainability of Humber Bay Park East, ensuring that it remains a vibrant natural space for future generations while conserving the local environment.
