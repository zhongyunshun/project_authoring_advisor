I'm sorry, but I don't have access to external documents or reports, including the "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final." However, I can help you understand common factors that typically influence the selection of slope stabilization alternatives. These may include:

1. **Site Conditions:** Geotechnical properties of the soil, existing vegetation, and hydrology can significantly impact the choice of stabilization methods.

2. **Cost:** Budget constraints often play a critical role in selecting the preferred alternative.

3. **Effectiveness:** The anticipated success of the alternative in preventing erosion or landslides is a primary concern.

4. **Environmental Impact:** Consideration of ecological effects and compliance with environmental regulations can influence the decision.

5. **Longevity and Maintenance:** The expected lifespan of the stabilization method and the level of ongoing maintenance required may sway the selection.

6. **Community and Stakeholder Input:** Local community preferences and stakeholder concerns may also be considered.

7. **Construction Feasibility:** The practicality of implementing the selected alternative given the site conditions and available technology.

If you have specific excerpts or details from the report youâ€™d like to discuss, feel free to share, and I can help analyze or summarize that information!
