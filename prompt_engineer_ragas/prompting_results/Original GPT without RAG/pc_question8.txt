I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific documents or their contents, including the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief." However, I can provide general recommendations for long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for slope stabilization measures. These may include:

1. **Regular Inspections**: Conduct periodic visual inspections of the slope to identify any signs of erosion, movement, or failure.

2. **Instrumentation Monitoring**: Install instruments such as inclinometers, piezometers, and settlement markers to monitor changes in slope stability and groundwater levels.

3. **Vegetation Management**: Maintain vegetation on the slope, as roots can help stabilize soil. Regularly assess and manage plant growth to ensure it does not obstruct drainage.

4. **Drainage Maintenance**: Ensure that drainage systems (like ditches and culverts) are clear of debris and functioning properly to prevent water accumulation.

5. **Repair and Reinforcement**: Promptly address any signs of distress, such as cracks or slumping, by reinforcing slopes or repairing drainage systems.

6. **Documentation and Reporting**: Keep detailed records of inspections, maintenance activities, and any changes observed to track the condition over time.

7. **Community Engagement**: Involve the community in monitoring efforts, such as training volunteers to report potential issues.
