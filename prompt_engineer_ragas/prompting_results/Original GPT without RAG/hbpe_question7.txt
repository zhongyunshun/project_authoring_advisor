In the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief," the selection of different erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and gravel beaches, was based on a combination of effectiveness in shoreline protection and considerations for environmental impact. The brief likely outlined the following factors in the decision-making process:

1. **Effectiveness**: Each structure's ability to withstand wave action, prevent further erosion, and protect the shoreline was assessed. For example, armourstone headlands are designed to absorb and deflect wave energy, making them effective in high-energy environments.

2. **Environmental Impact**: The potential effects on local ecosystems were a critical consideration. Structures that would disrupt natural habitats or alter sediment transport patterns were carefully evaluated. Gravel beaches, for instance, may have been preferred in some areas due to their lower impact on aquatic habitats compared to more rigid structures.

3. **Site-Specific Conditions**: The unique characteristics of the site, including geology, hydrology, and existing flora and fauna, influenced the choice of erosion control measures. An approach that blends with the natural environment and promotes biodiversity would have been prioritized.

4. **Sustainability**: The long-term sustainability of the chosen structures was likely a key focus. Solutions that required minimal maintenance and could adapt to changing environmental conditions were favored.

5. **Community Input and Aesthetics**: Stakeholder engagement and the visual appeal of the structures might have also played a role in their selection. Solutions that enhance recreational opportunities while maintaining natural beauty would have been considered.

In summary, the selection process for erosion control structures in the Humber Bay Park East project was multifaceted, balancing functional effectiveness with environmental stewardship and community values.
