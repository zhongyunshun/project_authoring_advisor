   - **Infrastructure Coordination**: They coordinate with other municipal services (like water and waste management) to ensure that the project integrates well with existing infrastructure.
   - **Public Safety and Services**: Local municipalities are responsible for ensuring that public safety is maintained during the project and that services to the community are not disrupted.

3. **Engineering Firms**:
   - **Design and Planning**: Engineering firms are responsible for the technical design of the sanitary infrastructure, ensuring that it meets engineering standards and is effective in protecting the environment.
   - **Project Management**: They oversee the construction process, managing timelines, budgets, and resources to ensure that the project is completed efficiently and effectively.
   - **Quality Assurance**: Engineering firms conduct assessments and inspections to ensure that the work meets the required specifications and standards.

4. **Community Stakeholders**:
