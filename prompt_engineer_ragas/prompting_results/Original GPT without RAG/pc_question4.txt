I'm sorry, but I cannot access external documents or specific reports, including the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP." However, I can provide a general overview of typical roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in a Class Environmental Assessment (EA) process. 

1. **Project Proponent**: The organization or entity proposing the project. Responsible for initiating the EA process, providing all necessary information, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

2. **Regulatory Authorities**: Government agencies that review the EA documentation to ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations. They may include local, regional, and federal agencies.

3. **Consultants**: Environmental consultants may be hired by the project proponent to conduct studies, prepare documentation, and assist in the assessment process.

4. **Stakeholders**: This includes local communities, Indigenous groups, and interest groups who may have an interest in the project. They are usually involved in the consultation process and can provide input on potential impacts.

5. **Public**: Members of the public who may be affected by the project. They can participate in public meetings and provide feedback during the consultation phases.

6. **Technical Review Committees**: Groups formed to provide expert opinions on specific aspects of the project, such as environmental impact, engineering, or community concerns.

7. **Legal Advisors**: May be involved to ensure that the EA process complies with legal and regulatory standards.

If you need more specific information about the roles and responsibilities in the context of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, I recommend consulting the actual document or the relevant local government or environmental authority that conducted the assessment.
