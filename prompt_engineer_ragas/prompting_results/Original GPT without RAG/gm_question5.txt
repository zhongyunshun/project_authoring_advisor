As of my last update in October 2023, specific details about future phases or expansions for the erosion control and slope stabilization efforts at Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent projects would typically be available through local government announcements, project reports, or community updates from the relevant municipal authorities or planning departments. For the most current and detailed information, I recommend checking the City of Toronto's official website or contacting the local planning office directly. They may provide insights into any future phases, timelines, and additional funding for these types of projects.
