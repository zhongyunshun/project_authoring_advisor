I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific documents or project briefs such as the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief." To find out if there are future plans or subsequent phases for slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope, I recommend checking the official documentation related to the project, or contacting the relevant municipal or project management authorities directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
