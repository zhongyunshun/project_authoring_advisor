The Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project outlines several specific measures to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, particularly for species identified within the area. These measures may include:

1. **Habitat Preservation**: Ensuring that critical habitats for local wildlife are preserved during the construction phase. This may involve delineating no-disturbance zones around sensitive areas.

2. **Timing Restrictions**: Implementing seasonal restrictions on construction activities to avoid disrupting breeding, nesting, or migration periods for sensitive species.

3. **Wildlife Corridors**: Establishing wildlife corridors or passages to allow safe movement of species across the project area, reducing fragmentation of habitats.

4. **Erosion Control Techniques**: Utilizing erosion control methods that are environmentally friendly, such as biodegradable mats or native plantings, to minimize habitat degradation.

5. **Monitoring Programs**: Initiating pre- and post-construction monitoring programs to assess the impact of the project on local wildlife populations and habitats, allowing for adaptive management if negative impacts are observed.

6. **Public Education**: Engaging the community and stakeholders in educational programs about local wildlife and the importance of conservation efforts.

7. **Revegetation with Native Species**: After construction, implementing a revegetation plan that includes native plants to restore habitats and provide food sources for local wildlife.

8. **Buffer Zones**: Creating buffer zones around sensitive areas to reduce noise and human activity, which can disturb wildlife.

These measures aim to minimize the ecological footprint of the project and ensure the protection of local wildlife while allowing for necessary construction and stabilization efforts.
