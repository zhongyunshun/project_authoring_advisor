The erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park addresses potential social impacts, particularly regarding access to parklands and community recreational spaces, through a combination of strategic planning and community engagement.

1. **Assessment of Risks**: The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) conducts thorough assessments of erosion hazards, which include evaluating the potential impacts on physical infrastructure and community access. As seen in the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project, the assessment considers risks to trail infrastructure, which directly affects public safety and park accessibility (Document 1, Page 30; Document 4, Page 2).

2. **Public Safety Measures**: The management plan includes implementing safety features to mitigate risks to park users. For instance, safety fences may be installed in areas where erosion poses a direct threat to trail users (Document 7, Page 40). These measures not only protect users but also maintain access to recreational spaces.

3. **Community Engagement**: The project includes opportunities for public input regarding the enhancement of recreational spaces and habitat restoration. Feedback on design alternatives, such as interim repairs and habitat improvements, is actively sought from the community to ensure that the social aspects of park use are considered (Document 3, Page 371; Document 18, Page 9).

4. **Long-term Solutions**: The proposed works aim to provide long-term protection of both sanitary infrastructure and recreational areas while improving aquatic and terrestrial habitats. This dual focus ensures that community recreational spaces remain accessible and enjoyable for residents (Document 18, Page 9; Document 19, Page 347).

Overall, the TRCAâ€™s approach to erosion hazard management in German Mills Settlers Park is designed to ensure that while the physical risks are mitigated, the social and recreational needs of the community are also prioritized.
