The anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, as outlined in the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP," include considerations for biological, physical, and socioeconomic factors.

### Environmental Impacts
1. **Biological**: 
   - No significant wildlife populations were identified within the project limits, and thus, no anticipated impacts are expected from the proposed works (Document 9).
   - The project plans to minimize impacts on existing natural habitats and will have the smallest construction footprint possible. Construction activities are scheduled to occur outside of key migration and breeding periods to protect local flora and fauna (Document 18).

2. **Physical**: 
   - There are no unique landforms or historic canals within or adjacent to the project limits, indicating no anticipated impact from these aspects (Documents 10 and 22).
   - Erosion and slope instability are influenced by surrounding land use, which is primarily urban. The project aims to address the risks associated with valley slope erosion to protect properties and human life (Document 3).

### Social Impacts
1. **Public Safety**: 
   - The project has assessed potential risks to public safety, particularly regarding access routes and the proximity of the work to residential areas (Document 11). Measures such as safety features (e.g., fences) are planned to mitigate these risks.

2. **Community Engagement**: 
   - Public notifications and consultations were conducted, starting with the Notice of Intent published on November 22, 2018, which included outreach to community groups and Indigenous communities (Document 4). This engagement is crucial for addressing social impacts and ensuring community concerns are considered.

### Addressing Impacts
The project proposes several strategies to mitigate anticipated impacts:
- **Construction Planning**: Ensuring construction occurs outside critical ecological periods, thus minimizing disturbance (Document 18).
- **Public Safety Measures**: Implementing safety features along trails and slopes to reduce risks to the public (Document 11).
- **Community Involvement**: Engaging with local stakeholders through notifications and consultations to address concerns and gather input (Document 4).

Overall, the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project is designed with a comprehensive approach to minimize both environmental and social impacts while addressing the pressing issue of slope erosion.
