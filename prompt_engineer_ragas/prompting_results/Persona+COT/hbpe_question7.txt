The "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief" outlines the selection of different erosion control structures, including armourstone headlands and gravel beaches, based on their effectiveness and environmental impact. The decision-making process considers several factors:

1. **Structural Stability**: The overall condition and structural stability of existing erosion control structures are assessed. For example, structures such as WF11.10 (Western Armourstone Headland) were found to be "failing" but rated "fair" overall, indicating the need for maintenance but also that they can be improved upon without complete reconstruction (Document 3).

2. **Erosion and Scouring Assessment**: The brief provides observations of erosion and scouring at various structures, which informs the choice of materials and designs. For instance, significant material displacement and scouring were noted along the eastern armourstone headland (WF11.12), necessitating interventions to reinforce these areas (Document 2).

3. **Environmental Considerations**: The use of smaller cobble sizes is highlighted as being more user-friendly for park visitors, although they require more material for effective protection, leading to higher costs and maintenance needs. This consideration balances user experience with ecological impact (Document 11).

4. **Interim Measures**: Temporary measures, such as placing additional stone in scour areas, are implemented while longer-term solutions are designed. This approach shows a commitment to immediate protection while planning for more sustainable solutions (Document 6).

5. **Design Concepts**: Proposed designs aim to address leading erosion concerns by placing new material over existing structures where stability permits, thereby minimizing excavation and environmental disruption (Document 5).

In summary, the selection of erosion control structures within the Humber Bay Park East project reflects a comprehensive evaluation of structural integrity, environmental impact, user-friendliness, and the necessity for sustainable long-term solutions.
