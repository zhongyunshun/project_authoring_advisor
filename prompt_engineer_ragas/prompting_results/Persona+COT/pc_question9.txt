Indigenous communities were engaged in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project through a structured consultation approach. This included:

1. **Public Notifications and Consultation**: The process started with the publication of a Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018, which informed community groups, homeowners near the project site, and Indigenous communities about the project (Document 2).

2. **Record of Indigenous Engagement**: A full record of Indigenous community consultation, including copies of all correspondence, is documented in the Record of Indigenous Engagement for the project, specifically found in Appendix D of the Class EA Project Plan (Document 1).

3. **Consultation with Specific Indigenous Groups**: The project engaged various Indigenous communities, including but not limited to:
   - Beausoleil First Nation
   - Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation
   - Chippewas of Rama-Mnjikaning First Nation
   - Huron-Wendat Nation
   - Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation (Document 3).

4. **Community Liaison Committee (CLC) Meetings**: The CLC meetings served as a platform for interested residents and stakeholders to engage with senior project staff, discussing proposed erosion control and slope stabilization works, timelines, and allowing for questions and feedback (Document 19).

As a result of this engagement, there were no major concerns raised by the Indigenous communities regarding the project, indicating a level of acceptance or agreement with the proposed plans (Document 1). This suggests that the consultation process was effective in addressing any potential issues or concerns within the Indigenous community.
