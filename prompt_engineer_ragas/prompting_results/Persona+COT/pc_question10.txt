The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity with specific considerations for bat species and butternut trees identified in the area.

1. **Butternut Trees**: The project brief notes the identification of a Category 2 butternut tree within the project area, which is classified as an endangered species protected under Ontarioâ€™s Endangered Species Act. The document states that a genetic test of the butternut indicated it is genetically pure but highly susceptible to butternut canker. The brief emphasizes that tree removals will be highly selective and planned to minimize impacts, with specific reference to a tree inventory and proposed removals detailed in the Arborist Report and Tree Preservation Plan for the project (Document 11).

2. **Bat Species**: The presence of bat habitat within the project area is acknowledged, and the brief indicates that appropriate compensation measures will be coordinated in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol. This implies that the project will not only recognize the habitat of bat species but also take steps to mitigate any potential negative impacts during construction (Document 8).

3. **General Biodiversity Considerations**: To minimize impacts on existing natural habitats, construction activities are planned to have the smallest possible footprint and will occur outside of key migration and breeding windows (Document 7). The brief highlights a commitment to restoration activities post-construction, focusing on replanting suitable native species to enhance overall biodiversity (Document 21).

In summary, the project brief outlines a proactive approach to biodiversity conservation, particularly concerning the sensitive butternut trees and bat species, ensuring that construction practices align with conservation objectives and regulatory requirements.
