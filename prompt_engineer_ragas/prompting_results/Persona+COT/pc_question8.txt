The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" outlines several long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies that are vital for ensuring the durability and effectiveness of the implemented slope stabilization measures. Here are the key strategies mentioned:

1. **Vegetation Maintenance**: There will be periodic maintenance of the vegetation during the first few years until the vegetation becomes well established. This is crucial for ensuring that the vegetation can provide the necessary support and stability to the slope.

2. **Sediment Control Monitoring**: The work area will be isolated with standard sediment control fencing to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse. Regular inspections and maintenance of these barriers will be required throughout the duration of construction and beyond to ensure ongoing effectiveness.

3. **Inspection of Stabilization Structures**: Continuous monitoring of the stabilization structures will be necessary to assess their condition and effectiveness over time. This includes checking for any signs of erosion or instability that may arise post-construction.

4. **Public Safety Measures**: The project includes provisions for safety features, such as safety fences, which will need to be regularly assessed for their condition and effectiveness in protecting public safety along the trail and slope.

These strategies are intended to mitigate risks associated with slope stability and ensure that the stabilization measures continue to function as intended over time.
