The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project has been divided into three phases for design and implementation due to the extensive area and multi-year nature of the construction. Each phase aims to address specific erosion concerns and restore the shoreline effectively (Document 1).

As for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, it is designed to stabilize slopes and control erosion, but the specifics regarding future phases or expansions are not explicitly detailed in the available documents. However, the project does consider ongoing needs for maintenance and potential future enhancements to ensure long-term effectiveness (Documents 3, 4, and 6).

In summary, the Humber Bay Park East project is confirmed to have future phases planned, while the Peacham Crescent project does not specify additional phases but implies ongoing management considerations. If you need more detailed information, please let me know!
