The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects like the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project are outlined as follows:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter. This is to ensure that the implemented erosion control works are stable and performing as designed.

2. **Site Restoration and Maintenance**: For example, in Phase I of the project, site restoration will include regrading and seeding. A full Restoration Plan will be developed as part of the detailed designs for the final phase, with plantings scheduled to occur after the implementation of the project.

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Prior to construction, staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated with standard silt socks to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse. This proactive measure helps maintain the integrity of the surrounding environment during and after construction.

These strategies aim to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the erosion control measures installed at Humber Bay Park East and to mitigate any potential impacts on the surrounding ecosystem.
