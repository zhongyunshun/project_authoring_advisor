The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" does not explicitly mention any future plans or subsequent phases for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope at Peacham Crescent. The focus of the document is primarily on the current project aimed at addressing upper slope instability behind the residential properties located at 21, 23, 25, and 27 Peacham Crescent. 

For any potential future phases or additional stabilization efforts, it would be prudent to consult ongoing updates from the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) or related environmental assessment reports. If you need specific details on future planning, I recommend reaching out directly to TRCA or checking their official communications for the latest information.
