The German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project involves several stakeholders, each playing critical roles to ensure the project's success:

1. **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA)**: The TRCA is a primary authority overseeing the project, focusing on the protection of the sanitary infrastructure and addressing erosion issues along German Mills Creek. They are responsible for managing the Environmental Assessment process and collaborating with other stakeholders to develop and implement protective works.

2. **York Region Environmental Services**: In partnership with TRCA, York Region plays a significant role in the project by providing local governance and support for the environmental assessments and infrastructure protection works. They assist in identifying at-risk sanitary sites and ensuring the project complies with regional environmental standards.

3. **Engineering Firms (e.g., Greck and Associates Limited)**: These firms are involved in the technical evaluation, design, and assessment of alternatives for the project. They conduct detailed studies, including geomorphic assessments and feasibility analyses, to propose effective solutions for the identified erosion and infrastructure protection issues.

4. **Indigenous Communities**: The project includes engagement with local Indigenous communities to ensure their perspectives and concerns are considered. TRCA has conducted correspondence and meetings to involve these communities in the planning process.

5. **Local Municipalities**: The municipalities involved, particularly the City of Markham, provide local context and support for the project, ensuring that the proposed works align with community needs and municipal regulations.

Together, these stakeholders collaborate to assess the risks, design appropriate infrastructure solutions, and ensure the project is executed in an environmentally sensitive and community-oriented manner. This collaborative approach is essential to address the erosion issues effectively and to protect the sanitary infrastructure within German Mills Settlers Park.
