The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation. Here are some key practices derived from the TRCA's technical documents:

1. **Erosion Control Measures**: The project addresses leading erosion concerns by implementing new material over existing structures to enhance toe and slope stability. This minimizes excavation requirements and helps protect the shoreline from further degradation, thereby conserving the natural habitat (Document 6).

2. **Phased Implementation**: The project is divided into three phases to manage construction effectively and reduce environmental impact. This phased approach allows for careful planning and monitoring of environmental effects during each stage of implementation (Document 3).

3. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: There will be inspections during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter to ensure the stability and performance of the implemented works. This ongoing monitoring is crucial for maintaining environmental integrity and making necessary adjustments (Document 12 and Document 18).

4. **Site Restoration**: Restoration efforts include regrading and seeding as part of the site restoration plan, which is aimed at reintegrating native vegetation and promoting biodiversity after construction is completed (Document 22).

5. **Climate Change Considerations**: The project takes into account climate change effects, such as increased storm frequency and intensity, and designs the protection structures to withstand potential future conditions (Document 14).

These practices collectively contribute to the sustainable development goals of the project, ensuring that the natural environment is preserved while addressing the pressing issues of erosion and habitat degradation in Humber Bay Park East.
