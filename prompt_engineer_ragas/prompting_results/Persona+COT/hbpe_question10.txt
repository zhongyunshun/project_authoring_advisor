The restoration plantings described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" play a significant role in mitigating biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk. The project includes a commitment to plant a substantial number of native treesâ€”specifically, 280 trees as part of the preliminary planting plans for Phases I and II. This initiative aims to restore local habitats by enhancing the biodiversity of the area, which is crucial for supporting at-risk species.

The focus on planting suitable native species is essential to create a robust local environment that can support various forms of wildlife and plant species. This approach is aligned with TRCA's goals to improve ecosystem health and resilience, as native species tend to provide better habitat and food sources for local fauna, including species at risk (Document 3).

Additionally, the restoration activities are designed to compensate for any tree or shrub removals that may occur during construction. This selective planning means that while certain trees may be removed, the net ecological impact is minimized through careful replanting and restoration efforts (Document 2). By fostering a diverse native vegetation community, the project aims to enhance overall biodiversity, which is critical for maintaining ecological balance and supporting species that are vulnerable to habitat loss (Document 4).

In summary, the restoration plantings outlined in the HBPE Project Brief not only aim to replace removed vegetation but also enhance the local ecosystem's biodiversity, thereby helping to mitigate against biodiversity loss and provide essential support for species at risk.
