The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" outlines several impacts on local wildlife, particularly aquatic species, resulting from the shoreline maintenance projects. The baseline inventory section indicates that a variety of aquatic species have been monitored in the area, including both native and introduced species such as Alewives, White Suckers, Rainbow Smelt, and Round Goby.

1. **Aquatic Habitat Alteration**: The project anticipates alterations to aquatic habitats due to construction activities. For example, the design of protection structures aims to minimize disturbances to native materials, suggesting an effort to mitigate impacts on the existing aquatic habitat. However, it is acknowledged that construction may result in the loss of certain fish habitats as evaluated in the planning stages (Document 3).

2. **Species Monitoring**: A baseline inventory was conducted that highlighted both the common and rare species in the region. Monitoring stations identified prevalent species, indicating a healthy aquatic ecosystem that may be affected by construction activities (Document 1).

3. **Mitigation Measures**: The TRCA has implemented specific mitigation measures to protect aquatic habitats during construction. This includes the installation of erosion and sediment control measures to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourses, thus helping to safeguard aquatic life (Document 16).

4. **Restoration Efforts**: The project also includes a plan for restoration planting, which aims to compensate for any negative impacts on local ecosystems. The preliminary planting plan proposes 152 compensation plantings to enhance habitat post-construction (Document 20).

In summary, while the shoreline maintenance projects are designed to improve the shoreline's structural integrity and environmental health, they also pose potential risks to aquatic species. The TRCA is taking steps to monitor and mitigate these impacts through careful planning and restoration efforts.
