The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several measures aimed at protecting local wildlife, particularly aquatic species, and minimizing disruption during construction. Here are the key strategies outlined in the technical documents:

1. **Baseline Inventory Conducted**: A thorough baseline inventory of aquatic life was performed, identifying species such as Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt. This information informs the design and implementation of protective measures (Document 1).

2. **Aquatic Habitat Alteration Minimization**: The project design includes protective structures that are specifically engineered to minimize cutting and disturbance of native materials along the shoreline. This approach is intended to mitigate any potential contamination and preserve existing aquatic habitats (Document 2).

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Before construction begins, staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated with standard silt socks to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse. This measure helps maintain water quality and protects aquatic life during construction activities (Documents 8 and 9).

4. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After the completion of major works, the site will be inspected annually and after significant storm events to ensure stability and performance of the implemented structures. This ongoing monitoring helps ensure that aquatic habitats remain protected in the long term (Document 22).

5. **Collaboration with Regulatory Bodies**: Discussions are ongoing between the TRCA, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), and other stakeholders to develop aquatic habitat features that enhance biodiversity and support the local ecosystem (Document 7).

These measures collectively aim to minimize disruption to local wildlife and enhance the ecological integrity of the Humber Bay Park East area during and after the maintenance project.
