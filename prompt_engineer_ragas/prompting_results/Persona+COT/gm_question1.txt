The "Slope Stability Analysis" methodology for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project involves a comprehensive assessment of the causes and extent of slope instability and erosion hazards impacting the project site. According to the documents retrieved from the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), the analysis includes several key steps:

1. **Site Assessment**: Initial evaluations were conducted to identify areas of instability and erosion. This includes historical data analysis and recent observations, particularly following significant weather events, such as the severe weather event on July 8, 2013, which exacerbated slope issues on Peacham Crescent.

2. **Geotechnical Investigations**: Detailed geotechnical investigations are performed to analyze soil composition, structure, and moisture levels, which are critical for understanding stability. The results guide the design of remedial measures.

3. **Stability Modeling**: The methodology incorporates stability modeling to predict potential slope failures. This includes determining a Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC) and calculating factors of safety. These models help to visualize the most stable configurations for the slope while considering human safety and property protection.

4. **Risk Assessment**: A risk assessment component evaluates the potential impacts of slope failure on surrounding infrastructure and properties. The TRCA considers both the likelihood of failure and the consequences of such events.

5. **Decision-Making**: The outcomes of the slope stability analysis directly influence project decisions, including the design and location of erosion control structures. The analysis supports the selection of appropriate remediation methods that minimize environmental impacts while ensuring long-term stability and safety.

The methodology's thoroughness ensures that the selected remediation solutions effectively mitigate risks associated with slope instability, ultimately guiding the implementation of protective measures for the properties affected by erosion on Peacham Crescent.
