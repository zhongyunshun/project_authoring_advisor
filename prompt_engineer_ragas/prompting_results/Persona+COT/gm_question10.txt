The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project involves tree removals and restoration plantings aimed at mitigating biodiversity loss, particularly regarding species at risk, such as bats and butternut trees.

1. **Tree Removals**: The project reports indicate that 180 trees will need to be removed, with an additional 38 trees expected to be injured to facilitate construction access and stabilization works (Document 12). While this may initially seem detrimental to biodiversity, the removal is planned to be highly selective and conducted outside critical periods, such as the bird breeding season (Documents 14). This approach minimizes direct impacts on wildlife populations by reducing disturbances during sensitive times.

2. **Restoration Plantings**: Following the construction, post-construction restoration activities will focus on replanting suitable native species to enhance soil stabilization and improve the biodiversity of the local ecosystem (Documents 6, 8). The planted vegetation is expected to provide habitat and food sources, thereby supporting local wildlife, including bats, which rely on healthy ecosystems for foraging.

3. **Protection of Butternut Trees**: The project specifically identifies butternut trees as a species at risk, with a genetically pure butternut found within the project area. This tree is protected under Ontario's Endangered Species Act (Document 1). Efforts to preserve butternut trees include retaining those that are not severely affected by butternut canker and implementing measures that could support their recovery (Document 21).

4. **Ecosystem Benefits**: The overall goal of the project is to minimize the footprint of construction activities, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of existing natural habitats. The planting of native species post-construction aims to enhance biodiversity, increase soil stabilization, and contribute to the ecological health of the area (Documents 5, 10). 

In conclusion, while the project requires tree removals, it is carefully planned to mitigate impacts through selective removals and restoration efforts, thereby supporting the recovery of species at risk and fostering biodiversity in the area.
