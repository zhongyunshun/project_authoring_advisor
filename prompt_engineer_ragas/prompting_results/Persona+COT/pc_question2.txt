The Ecology Survey for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project outlines several measures to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, particularly concerning species identified in the vicinity:

1. **Minimizing Construction Footprint**: All construction activities are planned to have the smallest construction footprint possible. This approach aims to limit disturbances to existing natural habitats within the project limits.

2. **Timing of Construction Activities**: Construction is scheduled to occur outside of key migration and breeding windows, which are critical periods for habitat use. This timing helps reduce the potential impact on wildlife during their most vulnerable phases.

3. **Restoration Plan**: A comprehensive restoration plan is set to be implemented post-construction, which will focus on restoring affected areas to support local wildlife and plant species.

4. **Tree Removal Considerations**: While there may be limited tree removals, it is stated that these will be minimal and highly selective. The intent is to ensure there is no significant overall impact on the welfare of vegetation communities, which can provide habitat for wildlife.

5. **Monitoring and Management**: Continuous monitoring during construction will help ensure that any unforeseen impacts on wildlife can be addressed promptly.

These measures reflect a commitment to safeguarding local wildlife during the project, as outlined in the TRCA's technical documents.
