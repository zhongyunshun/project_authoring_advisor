The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is planned to be carried out in three phases:

1. **Phase I**: This phase focuses on preliminary works, including site setup, removal of necessary trees, and the establishment of staging areas. It includes construction activities such as the installation of a temporary culvert and access bridge.

2. **Phase II**: Currently detailed in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II," this phase involves maintenance work on the western headland, including shoreline protection measures and site restoration efforts. Some preliminary restoration, such as seeding and trail repairs, will take place following this phase.

3. **Phase III**: Though specifics are less detailed in the available documents, it is indicated that this phase will include additional restoration and improvements, particularly in relation to beach materials and structures to help retain and manage these materials.

Overall, the project's phased approach allows for careful planning and execution to ensure the effective management of erosion risks and maintenance of park infrastructure. Each phase builds on the previous one, contributing to the overall restoration and enhancement of Humber Bay Park East.
