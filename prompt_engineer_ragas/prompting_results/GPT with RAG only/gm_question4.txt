In the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project, the roles of various stakeholders are as follows:

1. **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA)**:
   - TRCA is the primary agency responsible for the overall management and execution of the project. They conduct erosion risk management and prepare the necessary sanitary infrastructure protection works to prevent exposure of the Leslie Collector sewer within German Mills Creek. 
   - They also monitor at-risk sanitary sites along the creek and engage in correspondence with Indigenous communities to ensure proper consultation and involvement throughout the project.

2. **York Region Environmental Services**:
   - In partnership with TRCA, York Region plays a vital role in the planning and execution of the sanitary infrastructure protection works. They collaborate with TRCA to address the erosion issues and ensure that the project aligns with regional environmental standards and regulations.

3. **Engineering Firms (e.g., Greck and Associates Limited)**:
   - Engineering firms like Greck and Associates are engaged to conduct environmental assessments, evaluate alternatives for the project, and provide technical expertise. They prepare detailed reports and assessments that inform decision-making regarding the design and implementation of protection measures.
   - They are responsible for creating cost estimates, evaluating the physical and natural environment impacts, and ensuring that the project meets the required municipal class environmental assessment standards.

4. **Local Municipalities**:
   - Local municipalities, such as the City of Markham, are involved in the project to ensure compliance with municipal regulations and to facilitate communication with local residents and stakeholders. They may assist in addressing community concerns and providing local insights into the project.

5. **Indigenous Communities**:
   - Indigenous communities are engaged to ensure their perspectives and rights are respected throughout the project. TRCA has conducted consultations to gather feedback from these communities, which is essential for fostering good relations and ensuring culturally sensitive practices are adhered to.

In summary, the success of the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project relies on the collaborative efforts of TRCA, York Region, engineering firms, local municipalities, and Indigenous communities, each contributing their expertise, oversight, and community engagement.
