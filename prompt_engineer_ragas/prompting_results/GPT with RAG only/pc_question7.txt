Based on the "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final," the key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives included:

1. **Factor of Safety (FOS)**: The conceptual stabilization options were developed based on a required Factor of Safety of 1.3, ensuring that the designs would provide adequate stability against potential slope failures.

2. **Soil Composition and Conditions**: The assessment involved a review of subsurface materials, which predominantly consisted of very loose to compact/soft to stiff earth fill materials. The existing conditions of these materials played a crucial role in determining the feasibility of various stabilization methods.

3. **Feasibility and Constructability**: Each alternative was assessed for its feasibility and ease of construction, ensuring that the selected method could be realistically implemented given the site conditions.

4. **Cost Implications**: The economic aspects of each alternative were considered, including the initial construction costs and the long-term maintenance costs associated with each stabilization method.

5. **Erosion and Slope Stability Risks**: The alternatives were evaluated based on their effectiveness in mitigating erosion and addressing slope instability, which were primary concerns for the properties involved.

6. **Environmental Impact**: Consideration was given to the potential environmental effects of each alternative, ensuring that the selected solution would minimize negative impacts on the surrounding ecosystem.

These factors collectively guided the decision-making process to identify the most suitable slope stabilization alternative for the site behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent.
