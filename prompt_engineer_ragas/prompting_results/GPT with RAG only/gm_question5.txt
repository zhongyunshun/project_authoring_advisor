Yes, the erosion control and slope stabilization efforts discussed for the Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent projects are planned to occur in multiple phases. 

For the **Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project**, it has been divided into three phases for design and implementation due to the extensive nature of the project area and the multi-year construction timeline.

Regarding the **Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project**, while the documents primarily focus on the current project plan, it is common for such projects to be evaluated for future phases or expansions based on ongoing assessments of site conditions and erosion risks. The documents indicate considerations for potential impacts and future needs, although specifics on further phases or expansions beyond the current proposals are not explicitly detailed. 

In summary, both projects have future phases planned or considered as part of their ongoing management and response to erosion concerns.
