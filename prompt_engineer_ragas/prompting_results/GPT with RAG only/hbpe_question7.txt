In the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief," the selection of different erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and gravel beaches, was based on their effectiveness in addressing erosion concerns and their environmental impact considerations. 

1. **Effectiveness**: The various structures were assessed for their structural stability and overall condition. For example, the condition of erosion control structures like WF11.10 (Western Armourstone Headland) and WF11.11 (Cobble/Rubble Beach) was evaluated, highlighting deficiencies such as scouring, displacement of material, and impacts from overtopping during high water levels. These factors informed the choice of materials and design approaches to enhance stability and reduce erosion.

2. **Environmental Impact**: The designs aimed to minimize disruption to native materials and aquatic habitats. For instance, the concept designs for the beach involved filling over existing profiles rather than extensive excavation, which would preserve the native substrate and minimize habitat alteration. Additionally, smaller cobble sizes were considered for beach treatments, balancing user-friendliness with the need for sufficient protection, even though they would require more material and potentially lead to higher maintenance needs.

3. **Adaptive Measures**: Interim measures, such as placing additional stone in scoured areas, were also discussed to temporarily improve shoreline protection while more permanent solutions were developed. This indicates a responsive approach to managing erosion while considering immediate environmental impacts.

Overall, the selection process was guided by a comprehensive evaluation of structural integrity, environmental preservation, and the need for long-term resilience against erosion.
