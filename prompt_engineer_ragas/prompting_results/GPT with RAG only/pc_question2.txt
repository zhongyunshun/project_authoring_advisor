The Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project outlines several specific measures proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, particularly concerning species identified in the vicinity. These measures include:

1. **Minimizing Construction Footprint**: The project plans to have the smallest construction footprint possible to reduce disturbances to existing habitats.

2. **Timing of Construction Activities**: Construction activities are scheduled to occur outside of key migration and breeding windows. This timing is crucial to ensure that habitat use by wildlife is not disrupted during critical periods such as breeding and migration.

3. **Comprehensive Restoration Plan**: A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented post-construction to rehabilitate disturbed areas and restore habitats for local wildlife.

4. **Selective Tree Removal**: Tree removal will be minimal and highly selective, which is intended to maintain the overall health of vegetation communities and minimize impacts on bird habitats.

5. **Monitoring and Management**: The project includes provisions for ongoing monitoring and management of the site to ensure that wildlife populations and their habitats are protected throughout the project lifecycle.

These measures are designed to ensure that any potential adverse effects on local wildlife populations, particularly on species at risk or those identified during the Ecology Survey, are effectively mitigated.
