The shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" have several implications for local wildlife, especially the aquatic species highlighted in the baseline inventory. Here are some key points regarding their impact:

1. **Aquatic Habitat Alteration**: The proposed construction activities will likely alter existing aquatic habitats. The project documents indicate that the area of fish habitat that may be affected or lost due to construction has been evaluated. This suggests that careful consideration is being given to how the construction might disrupt the natural habitats of aquatic species, including those listed in the baseline inventory.

2. **Species Monitoring**: The baseline inventory conducted as part of the project has already identified several species present in the area, including both native and invasive species such as Round Goby (invasive), Smallmouth Bass (native), and Rainbow Smelt (native/introduced). The monitoring of these species will be essential to assess changes in their populations as a result of the project.

3. **Mitigation Measures**: The project includes mitigation measures that aim to minimize negative impacts on aquatic species. For example, the installation of erosion and sediment control measures is intended to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse during construction, thereby protecting aquatic habitats from potential contamination.

4. **Restoration Efforts**: The project plan includes an emphasis on site restoration following construction, which may involve replanting and habitat enhancement efforts. These restoration activities could help to support local wildlife, including the aquatic species affected by the maintenance activities.

5. **Collaboration with Authorities**: Ongoing discussions among the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), and other stakeholders regarding aquatic habitat features indicate a collaborative approach to ensuring that the needs of local wildlife are considered throughout the planning and execution of the project.

In summary, while the shoreline maintenance projects are necessary for the health and protection of the shoreline, they do pose potential risks to local wildlife, particularly aquatic species. The project aims to mitigate these impacts through careful planning, monitoring, and restoration efforts.
