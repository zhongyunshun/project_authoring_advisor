Yes, the documents detail specific engagements and consultations with local Indigenous communities during the planning and implementation phases of the projects. Here are some key points:

1. **Indigenous Engagement Process**: Indigenous Engagement is designed to provide Indigenous Communities with information about the project and to gather their input. This process varies based on the community and the project's scope (Document 1).

2. **Consultation with Authorities**: Prior to notifications, the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) was contacted for guidance on which Indigenous communities to engage (Document 2). Similar consultations were held with the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation (MIRR) and the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MOECC) (Document 10).

3. **Community Lists**: Various Indigenous community contact lists were used to ensure comprehensive engagement (Documents 2 and 10).

4. **Engaged Communities**: Specific communities mentioned include the Credit First Nation, Williams Treaties First Nations, Huron-Wendat Nation, Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, and others (Documents 3, 8, and 18).

5. **Documentation of Engagement**: A full record of Indigenous community consultation, including correspondence, is documented in the Record of Indigenous Engagement for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project (Document 6).

6. **Feedback Mechanisms**: The communication process is designed to respect the culture and practices of the engaged Indigenous communities, incorporating open dialogue and regular opportunities for feedback (Document 4).

7. **Summary of Engagement Activities**: Detailed summaries of correspondence and consultation activities with Indigenous groups are provided in the project documentation, including methods of communication and dates (Document 16).

8. **Interest in Studies**: Indigenous nations expressed interest in archaeological assessments and environmental studies, indicating their active involvement in the consultation process (Document 19).

Overall, the documents reflect a structured approach to engaging with Indigenous communities, ensuring their perspectives and concerns are incorporated into the project planning and implementation.
