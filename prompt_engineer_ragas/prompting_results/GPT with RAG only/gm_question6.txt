The erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park aims to address potential social impacts, including access to parklands and community recreational spaces, through a combination of infrastructure protection measures and enhancements to the natural environment. Here are some key strategies outlined in the documents:

1. **Sanitary Infrastructure Protection**: The primary goal of the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project is to prevent exposure of the Leslie Collector sewer and other sanitary infrastructure due to erosion along German Mills Creek. This ensures that essential services remain uninterrupted, which is vital for community health and safety.

2. **Environmental Assessments**: The project follows a Schedule B Municipal Water and Wastewater Class Environmental Assessment (MCEA), which assesses risks to both infrastructure and the environment. This process includes evaluating the potential effects on public access and recreational use of parklands.

3. **Safety Features**: Potential risks to trail and park users are considered in the project design. Safety features, such as safety fences, may be implemented to protect users from areas at risk of erosion.

4. **Habitat Enhancement**: The project includes a secondary objective of enhancing the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic habitat, which can improve the overall quality of the park experience for community members. Restoration efforts can lead to more diverse and resilient natural spaces, contributing positively to recreational opportunities.

5. **Community Involvement**: The planning process encourages public feedback on proposed measures. This involvement helps ensure that community needs and concerns regarding access to recreational spaces are taken into account during the project's development.

6. **Long-term Solutions**: The project aims to provide long-term solutions for the protection of regional sanitary infrastructure while also looking for opportunities to improve aquatic and terrestrial habitats, which can enhance the recreational quality of the park.

Overall, the management plan seeks to balance the need for infrastructure protection with the public's access to and enjoyment of parklands, ensuring that community recreational spaces remain safe and usable.
