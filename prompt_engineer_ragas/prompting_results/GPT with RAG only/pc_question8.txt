The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" outlines several long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies to ensure the durability and effectiveness of the implemented slope stabilization measures. While specific details were not included in the retrieved passages, typical strategies for such projects often include:

1. **Regular Inspections**: Conducting periodic assessments of the slope stabilization structures to identify any signs of deterioration or failure.

2. **Vegetation Management**: Implementing maintenance practices for vegetation to ensure that it becomes well-established, which could involve periodic trimming or removal of invasive species.

3. **Sediment Control Measures**: Maintaining sediment control fencing and other barriers to prevent erosion and sedimentation into nearby watercourses.

4. **Drainage Management**: Ensuring that drainage systems are functioning properly to mitigate water accumulation that could lead to slope instability.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**: Keeping detailed records of inspections, maintenance activities, and any observed changes in slope conditions, which can be crucial for future assessments.

For the exact recommendations, it would be necessary to refer to the specific sections of the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" that detail these strategies.
