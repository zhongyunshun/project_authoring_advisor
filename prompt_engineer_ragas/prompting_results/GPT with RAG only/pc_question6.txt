The "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" outlines several anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, as well as strategies to address these impacts:

### Anticipated Environmental Impacts:
1. **Wildlife Habitat and Populations**:
   - The project area does not contain significant wildlife populations or critical habitats; thus, no major impacts are anticipated from the proposed works (Documents 9 and 18).

2. **Vegetation Communities**:
   - Some significant vegetation communities might be affected, but the project aims to minimize impacts on existing natural habitats by maintaining a small construction footprint and scheduling activities outside key migration and breeding periods (Document 18).

3. **Riparian and Wetland Areas**:
   - There are wetland vegetation communities observed along the southern limits, but the project has assessed and stated that there will be no significant impacts due to the proposed works (Document 9).

4. **Physical Environment**:
   - The project will not impact unique landforms or historic canals, and there are no anticipated impacts to the physical environment based on the assessments (Documents 10 and 22).

### Anticipated Social Impacts:
1. **Public Safety**:
   - There are potential risks to public safety along trails and slopes, which are acknowledged in the plan. The project proposes to incorporate safety features, such as safety fences, to mitigate these risks (Document 11).

2. **Community Engagement**:
   - Public notifications and consultations were initiated, including a Notice of Intent published on November 22, 2018, to inform and involve community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities in the decision-making process (Document 4).

3. **Property Accessibility**:
   - Access routes to the project site have been proposed to ensure that properties remain accessible and that the works will not significantly disturb the surrounding community (Document 6).

### Mitigation Strategies Proposed:
- **Minimal Footprint**: Construction activities will aim for the smallest footprint possible to reduce ecological disruption (Document 18).
- **Timing of Activities**: Scheduling construction outside of critical periods for wildlife will help minimize impacts on flora and fauna (Document 18).
- **Safety Measures**: Implementing safety features to protect the public and ensure safe access around the construction site (Document 11).
- **Public Consultation**: Engaging with the local community and stakeholders to keep them informed and involved throughout the project process (Document 4).

Overall, the Class EA Project Plan emphasizes a proactive approach to mitigating potential impacts while addressing community concerns and ensuring public safety during the slope stabilization efforts.
