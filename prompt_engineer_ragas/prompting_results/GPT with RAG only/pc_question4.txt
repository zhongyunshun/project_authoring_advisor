The documents retrieved do not explicitly outline the defined roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the Class Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project. However, some implicit roles can be inferred from the context of the documents:

1. **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA)**: This organization plays a central role in the management and execution of the Class EA process. They are responsible for overseeing the project, conducting assessments, and ensuring compliance with the Conservation Authorities Act.

2. **Public Stakeholders**: Community groups, homeowners in the vicinity, and Indigenous communities are mentioned as recipients of notifications and consultations. Their role likely includes providing input and feedback during the public consultation process.

3. **Minister of the Environment**: The documents suggest that any requests or significant decisions regarding the project may be referred to the Minister for approval, indicating their role in the oversight and regulatory approval process.

4. **Environmental Consultants**: While not explicitly stated, there seems to be a reliance on environmental consultants and studies (e.g., ALS Environmental, Cole Engineering Group Ltd.) to conduct analyses and assessments related to the environmental impacts of the project.

5. **Project Team Members**: Individuals acknowledged in the acknowledgments section (e.g., Alistair Jolly, Alvina Tam) likely have specific roles in managing and implementing various aspects of the project, although their specific responsibilities are not detailed.

To obtain a clearer understanding of the roles and responsibilities, one might need to look at more detailed sections of the Class EA documentation or supplementary materials that outline stakeholder engagement processes and specific responsibilities.
