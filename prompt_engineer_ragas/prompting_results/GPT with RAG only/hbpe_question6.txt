The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project includes several considerations to address potential social impacts and ensure the safety of the local community:

1. **Public Safety**: The project acknowledges potential risks to public safety, particularly along the public footpath and the slope itself. Measures will be put in place to mitigate these risks, including the installation of safety features like fences to protect pedestrians and residents (Document 3).

2. **Public Notifications and Consultation**: The project follows the Class EA process, which includes public notifications and consultations. The first point of public contact was the publication of the Notice of Intent, which informed community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities about the project and its implications (Document 18). This engagement is crucial for addressing community concerns and feedback.

3. **Assessment of Existing Conditions**: The project plan includes assessments of existing conditions, including the identification of no significant wildlife populations or tourism operations within the project limits. This suggests that potential disruptions to local social structures have been considered (Document 11 and Document 7).

4. **Impact Rating**: The project includes a screening criteria process that rates the potential effects on various factors, including socioeconomic aspects of the surrounding neighborhood. This helps in understanding and addressing how the project may affect local communities (Document 15).

5. **Access Routes**: The project considers property accessibility by proposing access route options to minimize disruption while gaining access to the slope for stabilization work. This is important for maintaining community access to their properties during the construction phase (Document 7).

Overall, the project aims to mitigate risks to human life and property, engage with the community, and ensure that safety measures are in place to protect the local population during and after the stabilization efforts.
