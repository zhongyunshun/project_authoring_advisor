The future phases or expansions planned for Humber Bay Park East, as mentioned in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II," include:

1. **Phase II â€“ Western Headland**: This phase includes major maintenance and restoration work on the western headland.
2. **Phase III**: This phase is set to involve additional work, including the placement of beach material to the east of the structure, which is part of the overall project plan.

The project has been divided into three phases for design and implementation, indicating a structured approach to the maintenance and enhancement of the park's shoreline.
