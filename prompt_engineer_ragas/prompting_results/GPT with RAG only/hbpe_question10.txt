The restoration plantings described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" contribute to mitigating biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk, by focusing on the planting of suitable native species. This approach aims to enhance the overall biodiversity of the Project area, as the native species are better suited to the local ecosystem and can provide critical habitat for various wildlife, including species at risk.

Additionally, the planned replanting after tree or shrub removals is designed to compensate for the loss of vegetation, thus maintaining habitat availability for affected species. The commitment to plant a specific number of trees and to develop a comprehensive restoration plan emphasizes the importance of rebuilding the local habitat. By addressing the removal of exotic species and enhancing the representation of native species, the restoration efforts are expected to foster a more resilient and diverse ecosystem.

Moreover, the restoration activities are not only about replacing removed plants but also about improving ecological health and functionality, which is crucial for the survival of species at risk. The overall goal is to create a more robust local environment that supports biodiversity and aids in the recovery of sensitive species.
