The decision-making process for choosing specific erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches, involves several key considerations, including effectiveness, environmental impact, cost, and site conditions. Here is a detailed breakdown based on the retrieved documents:

1. **Effectiveness**:
   - **Armourstone Structures**: Armourstone revetments are often selected for their stability and ability to withstand wave forces, as noted in multiple documents. The sizing and placement of the armour stones are calculated using the Hudson equation to ensure they can effectively protect against erosion. For instance, documents describe the use of armour stone in the 2 to 4 tonne range, which has been deemed effective for stabilizing shorelines and preventing further erosion (Document 4, Document 14).
   - **Cobble/Rubble Beaches**: Smaller cobble sizes can provide a more user-friendly beach environment, but they require more material for sufficient protection. This can lead to higher costs and maintenance needs (Document 3, Document 8). The effectiveness of cobble beaches in dissipating wave energy and providing habitat is an important factor in their consideration.

2. **Environmental Impact**:
   - The impact on local coastal processes is a significant consideration. For example, some documents indicate that new revetment structures are designed to minimize disruption to existing coastal dynamics by being placed on the same footprint as existing structures (Document 1). This approach aims to reduce the ecological footprint and maintain the natural environment as much as possible.
   - The environmental implications of using larger stones versus smaller cobble materials are also considered. While larger armour stones provide robust protection, they may alter the natural habitat more significantly than smaller cobble, which could benefit aquatic life (Document 20).

3. **Cost and Maintenance**:
   - Cost considerations are crucial in the decision-making process. The documents highlight that while smaller cobble can be more user-friendly, the increased material requirement leads to higher construction and maintenance costs (Document 3). In contrast, the use of existing armour stone supplemented with additional materials is seen as a cost-effective approach that minimizes disturbance and construction time (Document 22).

4. **Site Conditions**:
   - Site-specific conditions, such as wave energy, erosion rates, and existing infrastructure, heavily influence the choice of structure. For example, the documents mention modeling strong wave conditions to assess the best materials and designs (Document 20). This ensures that the selected structure can withstand local environmental forces.

5. **Community and Stakeholder Input**:
   - Consultation with stakeholders, including local authorities like the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), plays a role in the decision-making process. This collaboration helps to align the erosion control solutions with community needs and environmental protection goals (Document 22).

Overall, the decision-making process for selecting erosion control structures like armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches is multifaceted, balancing effectiveness, environmental considerations, cost, and site-specific factors to achieve sustainable shoreline management.
