The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" include:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter to ensure that the implemented works are stable and performing as designed.

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Measures**: These measures will be implemented prior to and maintained during the construction phases to prevent sediment entry into the water. Damaged erosion and sediment control measures should be repaired or replaced within 48 hours of inspection.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular monitoring by trained professionals will be conducted during construction to ensure that all best management practices are being utilized to avoid or minimize disturbance to the environment.

4. **Restoration Activities**: Site restoration will include actions like regrading and seeding, with a full Restoration Plan being part of the detailed designs for the final phase of the project.

5. **Monitoring of Vegetation**: Post-construction monitoring of proposed vegetation will be conducted for two years after planting to ensure survivability and effectiveness.

These strategies are aimed at ensuring the long-term effectiveness and stability of the erosion control measures implemented during the project.
