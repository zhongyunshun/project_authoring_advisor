The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects like the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project include:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter. This is to ensure that the implemented works are stable and performing as designed.

2. **Site Restoration and Monitoring**: For Phase I of the project, site restoration will be limited to regrading and seeding. A full Restoration Plan will be part of the detailed designs for the final phase of the project, with plantings occurring after implementation.

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Prior to the start of construction, staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated with standard silt socks to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse. All barriers will be regularly monitored to ensure they are functioning effectively.

These strategies are designed to manage the integrity of the erosion control structures and maintain the health of the shoreline over the long term.
