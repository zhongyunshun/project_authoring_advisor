Indigenous communities were engaged in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project through a structured consultation process. The project documentation indicates that there was a full record of Indigenous community consultation, which included copies of all correspondence. This record can be found in the "Record of Indigenous Engagement" for the project, specifically in Appendix D.

The initial point of public contact occurred with the publication of a Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018, which informed community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities about the project. Several Indigenous nations, including the Beausoleil First Nation, Chippewas of Georgina Island, and Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, were specifically mentioned as being part of the consultation efforts.

In terms of outcomes, there have been no major concerns raised by either the public or the Indigenous communities regarding the project, as noted in the discussions of concerns. This suggests that the engagement process was effective, leading to a consensus or at least a lack of opposition from the involved Indigenous communities. The documentation reflects a commitment to involving Indigenous perspectives in the environmental assessment and planning process, though specific outcomes from the engagement (such as modifications to the project based on feedback) are not detailed in the provided passages.
