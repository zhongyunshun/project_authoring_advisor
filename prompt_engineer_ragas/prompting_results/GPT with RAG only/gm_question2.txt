The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project includes several measures aimed at protecting and minimizing disruption to local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory. Here are some key actions outlined in the documents:

1. **Cleared Archaeological Assessments**: The project has completed Stage 1 of the archaeological assessment, determining that Stage 2 was unnecessary. This approach helps to ensure that any potential disruptions to the habitat caused by archaeological activities are minimized.

2. **Aquatic Habitat Monitoring**: The project employs three monitoring stations to collect data on local fish populations, which includes species such as Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt. This ongoing monitoring helps assess the health of aquatic habitats and informs future conservation actions.

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Prior to the start of construction, staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated with standard silt socks to prevent the entry of harmful substances into the watercourse. This measure minimizes the risk of pollution and habitat degradation during construction.

4. **Protection Structures Design**: The design of protection structures along the shoreline is intended to minimize the cutting and disturbance of native materials, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of local aquatic habitats.

5. **Habitat Features Development**: Discussions are ongoing regarding the development of aquatic habitat features, such as a surcharged revetment, which aims to enhance the ecological value of the area and support local wildlife.

6. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After the completion of construction, the site will be inspected regularly, especially after major storm events, to ensure that the implemented works are stable and functioning as intended. This monitoring is vital to address any issues that may arise that could impact local wildlife.

7. **Restoration of Disturbed Areas**: The project mandates that any disturbed areas be restored to existing conditions or better, ensuring that habitats remain suitable for local wildlife.

These measures collectively contribute to the protection of local wildlife, particularly aquatic species, during the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project.
