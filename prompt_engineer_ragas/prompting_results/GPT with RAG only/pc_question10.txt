The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity with a focus on bat species and butternut trees through several key considerations:

1. **Bat Species**: The project acknowledges the presence of bat habitat within the project area. The brief mentions that appropriate compensation measures for bat species will be coordinated in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol. This indicates a proactive approach to mitigating any potential impacts on bat populations during the construction phase.

2. **Butternut Trees**: The identification of a Category 2 butternut tree along the proposed access route highlights the project's awareness of this endangered species, which is protected under Ontario's Endangered Species Act. The brief notes that the butternut tree within the construction access route is genetically pure but is also highly susceptible to butternut canker. This awareness suggests that the project planners are taking steps to assess and address the health and conservation of these trees during the construction process.

3. **Minimization of Impacts**: The brief states that tree removals will be minimal and highly selective, which aims to ensure that the overall impact on vegetation communities is limited. The emphasis on selective removals aligns with biodiversity conservation goals by protecting existing flora and fauna.

4. **Construction Timing**: To further mitigate impacts on biodiversity, particularly on breeding birds, construction activities are planned to occur outside of the bird breeding window. This timing minimizes the risk of disturbing nesting birds and supports the conservation of bird populations in the area.

5. **Restoration Activities**: The brief indicates that post-construction restoration activities will focus on replanting suitable native species. This effort is aimed at enhancing the overall biodiversity of the project site, compensating for any vegetation that is removed, and helping to restore the ecosystem.

In summary, the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" demonstrates a commitment to biodiversity conservation by addressing potential impacts on bat species and butternut trees through careful planning, timing of construction activities, and restoration efforts.
