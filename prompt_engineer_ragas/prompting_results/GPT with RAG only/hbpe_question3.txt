The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation. Key practices include:

1. **Erosion Control**: The project focuses on addressing erosion concerns by placing new materials over existing structures where stability permits, minimizing excavation and disturbance to the natural environment. This method helps to maintain the integrity of the shoreline while reducing potential harm to surrounding ecosystems.

2. **Phased Implementation**: The project is divided into multiple phases for design and implementation, allowing for careful planning, monitoring, and adjustment based on environmental assessments. This phased approach helps to minimize the impact on the environment during construction.

3. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: The site will undergo inspections after major storm events and on an annual basis to ensure that the implemented erosion control measures are stable and functioning as intended. This ongoing monitoring allows for timely maintenance and adjustments to protect the shoreline.

4. **Restoration Plantings**: Phase I includes site restoration efforts that will involve regrading and seeding, with a full Restoration Plan to be developed for future phases. This will enhance the ecological health of the area by promoting native vegetation.

5. **Climate Change Considerations**: The project acknowledges the impacts of climate change on the Great Lakes, including expected changes in water levels and increased storm intensity. Designs are being developed to enhance resilience to these factors, ensuring that the structures can withstand future environmental conditions.

6. **Minimizing Disturbance**: The design of protection structures takes into account the potential contamination of native materials, aiming to minimize cutting and disruption. This approach helps to preserve the existing ecosystem and habitats within the park.

These practices demonstrate a commitment to sustainable development and environmental stewardship in the management of Humber Bay Park East.
