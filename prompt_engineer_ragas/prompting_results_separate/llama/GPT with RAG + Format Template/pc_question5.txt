#### Are there any future plans or subsequent phases mentioned within the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope at Peacham Crescent? ####

After reviewing the retrieved passage and the provided documents, I did not find any explicit mentions of future plans or subsequent phases for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope at Peacham Crescent.

However, it is essential to note that some sections in the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" seem to imply potential future work or monitoring requirements. These sections include:

* Section 7: SURVEY REQUIREMENTS
* Section 9: EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL MEASURES

While these sections do not explicitly mention future plans or phases, they may suggest that additional work or monitoring requirements might be needed in the future.

To further clarify any potential future plans or phases for slope stabilization efforts at Peacham Crescent, I would recommend reviewing more recent documents or seeking clarification from relevant authorities.
