#### In light of the findings from the Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, what specific measures are proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, especially concerning species identified in the vicinity? ####

To address your question, I've reviewed the relevant documents provided. According to Document 4 (Metadata: source: 2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page: 10), a comprehensive restoration plan will be developed as part of the project's mitigation measures.

Document 5 (Metadata: source: 2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page: 44) mentions that the selected alternative meets all three (3) of the Project objectives:

1. Risk mitigation
2. Cost savings
3. Environmental sustainability

Based on these findings, it appears that the project's mitigation measures will focus on developing a comprehensive restoration plan to minimize impacts on local wildlife.

However, I would like to clarify some aspects of your question. Could you please provide more context or information about the specific species identified in the vicinity and how their habitats might be affected by the proposed works?
