#### In the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief", how were the different erosion control structures (e.g., armourstone headlands, gravel beaches) chosen based on their effectiveness and environmental impact ####

To determine how the different erosion control structures in the Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief were chosen, we need to analyze the document's content.

Based on the provided passages, it appears that the selection of erosion control structures was made with consideration for both effectiveness and environmental impact.

For example, in Document 1 (Page 5), it is mentioned that the armourstone headland has visible displacement of material, backshore erosion, and scouring. This suggests that the structure may require additional support or repair to ensure its stability and effectiveness.

Similarly, in Document 3 (Page 5), it is mentioned that the Table 1 summarizes the overall condition of the three erosion control structures included in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project. The table indicates that two of the structures are in fair condition, while one structure is failing.

Based on this information, it appears that the selection of erosion control structures was made with consideration for both effectiveness and environmental impact.

To determine the specific criteria used to select the erosion control structures, further analysis of the document's content would be necessary.
