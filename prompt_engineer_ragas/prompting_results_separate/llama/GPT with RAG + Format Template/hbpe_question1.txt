#### In the "Design Brief - Phase II" document, what specific engineering challenges and considerations were addressed during the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East? ####

Based on the provided documentation, the following specific engineering challenges and considerations were addressed during the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East:

1.  **Water Levels**: The overtopping rate was estimated using the methods for armoured slopes and walls presented in the Overtopping Manual (EurOtop, 2018).
2.  **Wave Overtopping**: The overtopping rate was estimated using the methods for armoured slopes and walls presented in the Overtopping Manual (EurOtop, 2018).
3.  **Design Considerations and Construction Costs**: The detailed design process included considerations of wave overtopping, surcharged revetment, habitat features, and construction costs.
4.  **Habitat Features**: Habitat features were installed as part of Phase I, consisting of surcharged stone at the base of the revetment at several points along the deepest part of the structure.

These specific engineering challenges and considerations were addressed during the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East.
