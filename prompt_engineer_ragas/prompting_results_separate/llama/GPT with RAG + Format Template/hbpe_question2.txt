#### How do the shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" impact the local wildlife, particularly the aquatic species mentioned in the baseline inventory section? ####

To answer this question, we need to examine the relevant sections of the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" document.

The baseline inventory section (Table 2) provides a summary of the baseline conditions reviewed. It includes information on the total count and weight (g) of native/introduced/invasive species found in the area.

According to the table, some aquatic species mentioned include:

* Round Goby: Neogbius melanstomus
* Shorthead Redhorse: Moxostoma macrolepidotum
* Smallmouth Bass: Micropterus dolomieu

In terms of potential impacts on local wildlife, particularly aquatic species, the project brief mentions several measures to minimize environmental impacts:

* Aquatic habitat features were installed as part of Phase I, consisting of surcharged stone at the base of the revetment.
* A similar approach is planned for Phase II along the Western Headland.

However, it is essential to note that the potential impacts on local wildlife may not be fully addressed by these measures. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct further research and analysis to determine the actual environmental impacts of the project.
