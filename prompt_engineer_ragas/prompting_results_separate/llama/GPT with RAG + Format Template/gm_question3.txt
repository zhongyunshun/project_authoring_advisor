#### How does the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project incorporate sustainable development practices to ensure long-term environmental conservation? ####

To address this query, we need to examine the Class EA Project Plan documents for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project.

The available information suggests that the project is being completed in accordance with the Class Environmental Assessment for Remedial Flood and Erosion Control Projects (Class EA) (amended 2013).

However, upon reviewing the provided documentation, we do not have specific details on how sustainable development practices are incorporated to ensure long-term environmental conservation.

To provide a more accurate answer, further information or specific documentation related to sustainable development practices in this project would be necessary.
