#### Could you detail the decision-making process behind choosing specific erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches, in the context of their effectiveness and environmental impact? ####

Based on the TRCA documents provided, it appears that the decision-making process involves a combination of technical considerations, environmental factors, and stakeholder input.

The document "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf" (page 5) mentions that the project team considered various erosion control structures, including armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches.

The document "Design Brief - Phase I.pdf" (page 18) provides more details on the decision-making process. It states that the project team evaluated different options for the eastern headland transition, including a revetment structure and an embayment/headland structure.

The document also mentions that the project team considered various factors when making their decisions, including the effectiveness of the erosion control structures in protecting the shoreline, the environmental impact of the structures on the surrounding ecosystem, and stakeholder input from local communities and interest groups.

In summary, the decision-making process for choosing specific erosion control structures involves a combination of technical considerations, environmental factors, and stakeholder input.
