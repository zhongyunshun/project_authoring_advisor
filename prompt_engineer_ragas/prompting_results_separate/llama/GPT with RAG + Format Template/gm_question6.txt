#### How does the erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park plan to address potential social impacts, such as access to parklands and community recreational spaces? ####

To answer this question, we need to refer to Document 4: "The German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project is being completed in accordance with a Schedule B Municipal Water and Wastewater Class Environmental Assessment (MCEA)."

As stated in the document, the project aims to protect sanitary infrastructure from erosion hazards. However, this might have potential social impacts on access to parklands and community recreational spaces.

According to Document 12: "The aquatic habitat within the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project area has been highly influenced by anthropogenic disturbance."

This suggests that the project aims to address these disturbances and restore the natural environment. However, this might require trade-offs between environmental protection and social access to parklands.

In summary, while the erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park does not explicitly mention addressing potential social impacts, it is likely that the project will aim to balance environmental protection with social considerations.
