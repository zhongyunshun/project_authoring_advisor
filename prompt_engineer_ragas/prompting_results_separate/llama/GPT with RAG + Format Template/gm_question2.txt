#### What measures are being taken in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project to ensure the protection and minimal disruption of local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory? ####

Based on the retrieved passages, it appears that several measures are being taken to protect local wildlife:

1. **Tree protection barriers**: These will be erected where necessary to prevent damage to trees during construction.

2. **Aquatic habitat features**: The project plans to develop aquatic habitat features for the design, which will help to support and protect local aquatic species.

3. **Post-construction monitoring**: The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter to ensure that the implemented works are stable and performing as designed.

These measures suggest a commitment to protecting local wildlife, particularly aquatic species, throughout the project's design and implementation phases.
