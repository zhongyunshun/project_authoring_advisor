#### In the development and implementation of TRCA projects like those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay, how are local Indigenous communities consulted or involved? ####

According to the provided documents, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) recognizes the importance of consulting with Aboriginal communities on planning matters that may affect their rights and interests.

In the case of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, TRCA conducted a thorough consultation process with local Indigenous communities. This included:

1.  Notifying Indigenous communities of the project through various means (e.g., courier, email).
2.  Establishing a Community Liaison Committee to facilitate communication and engagement between TRCA and local Indigenous communities.
3.  Conducting a thorough review of the project's potential impacts on Indigenous communities and their rights.

The documents also mention that TRCA has in-house licensed archaeologists who are responsible for conducting archaeological assessments and providing recommendations to support informed decision-making.

In summary, based on the provided documents, it appears that TRCA takes a collaborative approach to consulting with local Indigenous communities. This includes notifying them of project plans, establishing community liaison committees, and conducting thorough reviews of potential impacts on Indigenous rights.
