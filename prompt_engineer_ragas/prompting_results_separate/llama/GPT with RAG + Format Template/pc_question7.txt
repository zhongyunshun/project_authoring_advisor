#### Based on the "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final", what were the key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives? ####

According to the "Conceptual Alternatives Report for Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization behind 21, 23, & 25 Peacham Crescent" (Terraprobe Inc., 2019), p. 1:

"...the subject site behind 21, 23, & 25 Peacham Crescent predominantly consists of very loose to compact/soft to stiff earth fill materials..."

The key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives include:

* The dominant soil condition on the site (very loose to compact/soft to stiff earth fill materials).
* The need for slope stabilization to address erosion and slope instability hazards.
* The importance of selecting a conceptual slope stabilization alternative that balances feasibility, constructability, cost, and environmental considerations.
