#### How were Indigenous communities engaged in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, and what outcomes resulted from this engagement? ####

To answer this question, we need to look at the documents provided.

From Document 1 (Record of Indigenous Engagement), it is clear that Indigenous community consultation was a significant part of the project planning process. This includes copies of all correspondence found in Appendix D.

However, without further information or clarification on specific outcomes resulting from Indigenous community engagement, it is difficult to provide a complete answer.

Therefore, I would like to ask for more information or clarification on this topic. Could you please provide more details on what outcomes resulted from the engagement with Indigenous communities?
