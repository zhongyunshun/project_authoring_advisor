#### What long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies are outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects like the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project? ####

To answer this question, we need to refer to the project documents. According to Section 4 of the Detailed Design Report (Final Phase 1) for the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, the following long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies are outlined:

* The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter.
* Any maintenance required will be identified through regular inspections and monitoring of the erosion control measures.

It's worth noting that these strategies are based on Section 4 of the Detailed Design Report (Final Phase 1) for the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, which is available in the project documents.
