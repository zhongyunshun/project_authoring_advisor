#### Anticipated Environmental and Social Impacts of the Slope Stabilization Project:

1. **Habitat disruption**: The construction process may damage or destroy habitats for various plant and animal species.
2. **Water pollution**: Erosion from the slope stabilization project may lead to increased sedimentation in nearby water bodies, potentially harming aquatic life.
3. **Community displacement**: Depending on the scope of the project, local residents may be temporarily or permanently displaced due to noise, dust, or other construction-related issues.
4. **Traffic and access impacts**: The project's construction phase may result in road closures or rerouting, affecting local traffic patterns and potentially causing congestion.

#### How does the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" propose to address these impacts?

The proposed mitigation measures outlined in the document include:

1.  **Environmental monitoring**: Regular water quality monitoring will be conducted during construction to ensure that sedimentation levels do not exceed acceptable limits.
2.  **Erosion control measures**: The project will implement temporary and permanent erosion control measures, such as silt fences, sedimentation ponds, and revegetation of disturbed areas.
3.  **Community engagement and outreach**: The project team will engage with local residents through regular community meetings to provide information on the project's status, anticipated impacts, and mitigation measures.
4.  **Traffic management plans**: To minimize traffic congestion during construction, the project team will develop a comprehensive traffic management plan that includes strategies for managing traffic flow, reducing congestion, and minimizing disruptions to local traffic patterns.

By implementing these mitigation measures, the proposed slope stabilization project aims to minimize its environmental and social impacts while ensuring the safety of workers, residents, and visitors.
