#### Unfortunately, I couldn't find any specific information regarding the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project and its engagement with Indigenous communities. It's possible that this project is not well-documented or that it was carried out by a local authority without public record. 

However, I can provide some general information on how Indigenous communities are often engaged in planning and decision-making processes for infrastructure projects.

In recent years, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of engaging with Indigenous communities in the planning and decision-making processes for infrastructure projects. This recognition is reflected in policies and guidelines that emphasize the need for meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities.

Some common practices for engaging with Indigenous communities include:

1. Early and ongoing consultation: This involves consulting with Indigenous communities early in the project planning process, and continuing to engage with them throughout the project lifecycle.
2. Involving Indigenous representatives in decision-making processes: This can involve involving Indigenous representatives on project advisory committees or other decision-making bodies.
3. Providing opportunities for Indigenous community members to participate in project planning and decision-making: This can involve providing training and capacity-building programs for Indigenous community members, as well as providing opportunities for them to participate in project planning and decision-making.

It's worth noting that the effectiveness of these engagement practices depends on a range of factors, including the level of trust and relationship-building between the project team and Indigenous community representatives.
