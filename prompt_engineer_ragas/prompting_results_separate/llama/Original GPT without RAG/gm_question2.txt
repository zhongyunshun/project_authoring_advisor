#### The project team is implementing several measures to minimize the disruption of local wildlife during the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project:

1. **Ecological assessments**: Regular monitoring and assessment of aquatic species and their habitats will be conducted throughout the project duration.

2. **Habitat restoration**: Any damaged or disturbed habitats will be restored to their original condition, ensuring that local wildlife can thrive in their natural environment.

3. **Wetland enhancement**: The wetlands within Humber Bay Park East will be enhanced through the removal of invasive species and the reintroduction of native vegetation.

4. **Community engagement**: Regular public outreach and education programs will be implemented to raise awareness about the importance of protecting local wildlife and the measures being taken to minimize disruption during the project.

5. **Wildlife monitoring**: Trained wildlife observers will monitor the area throughout the project duration, ensuring that any potential impacts on local wildlife are quickly identified and addressed.
