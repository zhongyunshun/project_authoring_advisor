#### In the "Design Brief - Phase II" document, what specific engineering challenges and considerations were addressed during the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East? ####

Unfortunately, I do not have information about the "Design Brief - Phase II" document or its contents. 

However, I can suggest some possible sources where this information might be available:

1. City of Toronto's official website: You may be able to find the design brief and related documents on the city's website.
2. Humber Bay Park East's project webpage: If you can find a project webpage for Humber Bay Park East, it may contain links to relevant design briefs and documents.
3. City of Toronto's Engineering Services department: You may be able to contact the Engineering Services department directly and ask if they have access to the design brief and related documents.

If you are unable to locate this information, I suggest trying to contact a local expert or professional in the field of engineering or urban planning.
