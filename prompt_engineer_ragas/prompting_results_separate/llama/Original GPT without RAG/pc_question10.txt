#### Unfortunately, I do not have access to the document "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" as it is not publicly available. 

However, based on your query, I can suggest some potential ways that the project brief might address impacts on biodiversity:

*   **Bat Species:** The project brief may include measures to mitigate potential impacts on bat species, such as:
    *   Conducting surveys and monitoring bat populations before, during, and after construction.
    *   Identifying areas with high bat activity and taking steps to minimize disturbance or damage to habitats.
    *   Developing strategies for mitigating any negative impacts on bat populations, such as implementing measures to reduce noise pollution or install artificial roosts.
*   **Butternut Trees:** The project brief may also include measures to mitigate potential impacts on butternut trees, such as:
    *   Conducting a thorough assessment of the existing butternut tree population in the area and identifying any areas of high conservation value.
    *   Developing strategies for mitigating any negative impacts on butternut trees, such as implementing measures to reduce soil compaction or install protective fencing around individual trees.
    *   Identifying opportunities for enhancing the butternut tree population in the area, such as planting new trees or providing support for existing trees.

Without access to the document, I can only provide speculative suggestions.
