#### Unfortunately, I do not have access to the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" document. However, based on my research and available information about Humber Bay Park East, here are some potential future phases or expansions that may be planned:

1. **Trail expansion**: The park's trails could be expanded to provide more opportunities for hiking, biking, and other outdoor activities.
2. **Beach area improvements**: The beach area at Humber Bay Park East could be improved with the addition of new amenities such as picnic tables, benches, or even a playground for kids.
3. **Waterfront development**: As part of the park's expansion plans, there may be opportunities for waterfront development, including the construction of new buildings, piers, or other waterfront structures.
4. **Environmental enhancements**: The park could also benefit from environmental enhancements, such as the restoration of natural habitats, the creation of wildlife corridors, or the implementation of sustainable landscaping practices.

Please note that these are just potential future phases or expansions and may not reflect the actual plans for Humber Bay Park East.
