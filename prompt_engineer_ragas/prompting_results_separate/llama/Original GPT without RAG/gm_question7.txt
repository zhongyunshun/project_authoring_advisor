#### Decision-Making Process for Erosion Control Structures

The decision-making process behind choosing specific erosion control structures involves considering several factors, including:

1. **Erosion Risk**: Assessing the likelihood of erosion and the potential impact on the surrounding environment.
2. **Water Energy**: Considering the energy of the water, including wave height, tide range, and currents.
3. **Coastal Geology**: Evaluating the geology of the coastline, including the type of rock or sediment, its texture, and any underlying structures.
4. **Environmental Impact**: Assessing the potential environmental impact of each erosion control structure, including effects on aquatic habitats, water quality, and coastal ecosystems.

**Armourstone Headlands**

In areas with high wave energy and steep slopes, armourstone headlands can be an effective erosion control measure. Armourstone is a type of rock used for erosion control that has been shaped to fit together tightly. The benefits of armourstone headlands include:

* High effectiveness in controlling erosion
* Ability to withstand high wave energies
* Low maintenance requirements

However, armourstone headlands also have some potential drawbacks, including:

* High upfront costs
* Potential impacts on aquatic habitats and water quality
* Possibility of damage from extreme weather events

**Cobble/Rubble Beaches**

In areas with lower wave energy and gentler slopes, cobble/rubble beaches can be a more effective erosion control measure. These types of beaches are characterized by small to large rocks or gravel that have been deposited along the shoreline.

The benefits of cobble/rubble beaches include:

* High effectiveness in controlling erosion
* Ability to withstand moderate wave energies
* Low maintenance requirements

However, cobble/rubble beaches also have some potential drawbacks, including:

* High upfront costs
* Potential impacts on aquatic habitats and water quality
* Possibility of damage from extreme weather events

Ultimately, the decision between armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific erosion control needs of the area, the local geology and hydrology, and any relevant environmental or regulatory considerations.
