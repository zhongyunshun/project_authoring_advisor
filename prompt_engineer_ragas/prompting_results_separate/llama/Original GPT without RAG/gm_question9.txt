#### In the development and implementation of TRCA projects like those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay, how are local Indigenous communities consulted or involved?

The Toronto Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) has made commitments to consult with and involve local Indigenous communities in its project planning and decision-making processes.

Some examples of this commitment include:

*   **Indigenous Advisory Committee**: TRCA has established an Indigenous Advisory Committee to provide guidance on Indigenous engagement, cultural sensitivity, and reconciliation.
*   **Community Engagement**: TRCA engages with local Indigenous communities through various outreach initiatives, such as public meetings, surveys, and focus groups.
*   **Cultural Sensitivity Training**: TRCA provides cultural sensitivity training for its staff and contractors to ensure they are aware of the historical and ongoing impacts of colonialism on Indigenous communities.

By incorporating these commitments into its project planning and decision-making processes, TRCA aims to build trust with local Indigenous communities and create positive outcomes that benefit both people and nature.
