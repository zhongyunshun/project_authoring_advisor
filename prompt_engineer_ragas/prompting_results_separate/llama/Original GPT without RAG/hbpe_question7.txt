#### In the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief", different erosion control structures were chosen based on their effectiveness and environmental impact through a multi-criteria evaluation approach.

Key factors considered in this process included:

1. **Erosion rate reduction**: The ability of each structure to reduce erosion rates.
2. **Cost-effectiveness**: The relationship between the cost of each structure and its expected performance.
3. **Environmental impact**: The potential effects of each structure on the surrounding ecosystem, including habitats for plants and animals.
4. **Aesthetic appeal**: The visual impact of each structure on the park's landscape.

By considering these factors, the designers were able to select the most effective erosion control structures while minimizing environmental impact and maximizing aesthetic appeal.
