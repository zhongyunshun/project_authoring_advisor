#### Unfortunately, I do not have enough information to accurately answer the question. However, I can provide you with a general idea of what "Long-Term Stable Slope Crests" (LTSSC) might refer to in the context of slope stability and erosion risk assessment.

In general, LTSSC refers to the stable condition of a slope crest over an extended period of time, typically years or decades. The criteria used to determine LTSSC may include:

* Geotechnical factors such as soil type, strength, and density
* Topographic factors such as slope angle, length, and curvature
* Hydrological factors such as rainfall intensity, duration, and frequency
* Environmental factors such as vegetation cover, root depth, and soil moisture content

These criteria are used to evaluate the stability of a slope crest over an extended period of time. The specific criteria used may vary depending on the location, geology, and hydrology of the site.

Without more information about the Peacham Crescent projects, it is difficult to provide a more specific answer to your question.
