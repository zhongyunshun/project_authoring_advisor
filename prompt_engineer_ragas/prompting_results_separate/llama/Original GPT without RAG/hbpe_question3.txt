#### The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project has incorporated several sustainable development practices to ensure long-term environmental conservation. Some of these practices include: 

1. **Native Plant Species:** The project team has opted for native plant species that require less maintenance and are more resilient to local climate conditions.

2. **Rainwater Harvesting System:** A rainwater harvesting system has been installed on-site to collect and store rainwater for non-potable uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing.

3. **Energy-Efficient Lighting:** The project team has opted for energy-efficient LED lighting throughout the park to reduce energy consumption and minimize the carbon footprint of the project.

4. **Reduced Waste Generation:** The project team has implemented strategies to minimize waste generation on-site, including recycling, composting, and reducing the use of single-use plastics.

5. **Community Engagement and Education:** The project team has engaged with local community members, schools, and other stakeholders to educate them about the sustainable development practices being implemented in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project.

These sustainable development practices are expected to contribute to long-term environmental conservation, minimize the carbon footprint of the project, and promote community engagement and education.
