Based on the provided documents, the specific measures proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife are:

* The removal of select canopy trees will result in only minimal impacts to bird habitat.
* Construction activities will only occur outside of the bird breeding window.

These measures aim to minimize the impact on local wildlife while still achieving the objectives of the project.
