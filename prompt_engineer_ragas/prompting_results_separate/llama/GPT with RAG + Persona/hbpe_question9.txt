#### Are there any specific engagements or consultations with local Indigenous communities detailed in the projects' planning and implementation phases ? ####

After analyzing the provided documents, it appears that several projects have engaged with local Indigenous communities through various means.

For example:

- Document 17 (APPENDIX A: DOCUMENTATION OF INDIGENOUS ENGAGEMENT) mentions a notification to Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation regarding archaeological assessments and environmental studies.
- Document 18 lists Beausoleil First Nation, Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, Chippewas of Rama First Nation, Conseil de la Nation Huronne-Wendat, Curve Lake First Nation, Hiawatha First Nation, Mississaugas of Alderville First Nation, and Mississaugas of Scugog First Nation as communities with established or potential Aboriginal or Treaty rights within the study area.

These examples illustrate that several projects have engaged with local Indigenous communities through various means. However, it is essential to note that these engagements may not be comprehensive or inclusive of all local Indigenous communities.
