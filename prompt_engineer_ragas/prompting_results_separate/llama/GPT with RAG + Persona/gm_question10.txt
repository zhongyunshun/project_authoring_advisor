# Answer
The specified tree removals and restoration plantings in projects like the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project contribute to or mitigate against biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk such as bats and butternut trees.

## Restoration Plantings
Restoration plantings of native species are expected to enhance the overall biodiversity of the project area once they become established. This is because the planted vegetation will provide increased soil stabilization, reduce surficial erosion, and add to the local ecosystem's biodiversity.

## Tree Removals
Tree removals in projects like the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project may be necessary to facilitate construction access and undertake stabilization works. However, tree removal numbers should be determined during detailed design to include construction-related disturbances and plan any refinements.

## Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures such as replanting suitable native species after construction activities can help to compensate for those that were removed and enhance the overall biodiversity of the project area.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the specified tree removals and restoration plantings in projects like the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project contribute to or mitigate against biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk such as bats and butternut trees.
