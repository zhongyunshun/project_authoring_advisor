#### Answer

The Slope Stability and Erosion Risk Assessment defines "Long-Term Stable Slope Crests" (LTSSC) as the natural regression of a slope crest resulting from erosion forces. The LTSSC is determined using geotechnical investigations, including borehole drilling and soil testing.

The criteria used to determine the LTSSC include:

1. Factor of Safety (FS): A minimum FS of 1.5 is required for the LTSSC.
2. Geotechnical parameters: The geotechnical properties of the slope material, such as cohesion, angle of internal friction, and unit weight, are evaluated to determine the stability of the slope.
3. Borehole data: The results from borehole drilling and logging, including measurements of soil density, water content, and other relevant properties, are used to evaluate the stability of the slope.

These criteria are used in combination with geotechnical investigations and analyses to determine the LTSSC for the Peacham Crescent projects.
