# Answering the Query
The query is: #### Are there future phases or expansions planned for the erosion control and slope stabilization efforts discussed in the Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent projects? ####

Based on the retrieved passages, it appears that the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project and the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project are both divided into multiple phases.

From Document 4 (Page 29), it is mentioned that "The adjacent parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent is actively used for recreational purposes."

From Document 7 (Page 30), it is mentioned that "There are no historic canals within or adjacent to the Project limits; therefore, there will be no impacts resulting from the proposed works."

However, from Document 13 (Page 16), it is mentioned that "The location of the projected long-term stable slope crest (LTSSC) in relation to permanent and essential structures at the top of slope..."

Based on this information, it appears that future phases or expansions may be planned for the erosion control and slope stabilization efforts discussed in the Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent projects.

However, a more detailed analysis of the documents would be required to provide a more definitive answer.
