# Decision-Making Process

The decision-making process behind choosing specific erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches, involves several factors.

1.  **Effectiveness**: The chosen structures must be effective in preventing or mitigating the effects of coastal erosion.
2.  **Environmental Impact**: The selected structures should have minimal adverse environmental impact, such as disrupting marine habitats or affecting water quality.
3.  **Cost-Effectiveness**: The chosen structures should provide a cost-effective solution to addressing coastal erosion.
4.  **Community Engagement and Stakeholder Input**: The decision-making process should involve community engagement and stakeholder input to ensure that the chosen structures meet the needs of local communities.

# Phased Approach

The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is divided into multiple phases, each with specific timelines. The available document focuses on Phase I, which includes:

1.  **Repair of the Eastern Headland Transition**: This involves establishing a backshore armourstone wall and headland to create a small habitat embayment.
2.  **Transition Point between the Eastern Headland and Beach**: This phase involves the transition point between the eastern headland and beach.

The project's phased approach ensures that the work is completed in a logical and sequential manner, minimizing disruptions to local communities and stakeholders.
