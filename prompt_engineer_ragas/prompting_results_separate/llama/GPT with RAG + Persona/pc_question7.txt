To answer the query: "#### Based on the '2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final', what were the key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives? ####"
I need to analyze the provided documents and identify the key factors that influenced the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives.

From Document 14, we can see that the subject slope behind 21, 23, & 25 Peacham Crescent predominantly consists of very loose to compact/soft to stiff earth fill materials (about 4.5 meters thick).

Document 8 mentions that the MSE structure along the upper slope behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent was the preferred slope stabilization solution.

From Document 13, we can see that the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) developed a Class Environmental Assessment (EA) project plan for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project.

From Document 14, we can see that the conceptual stabilization options for this site are developed based on a Factor of Safety (FOS) of 1.3 as requested by TRCA.

Based on these documents, I would say that the key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives include:

* The existing geotechnical conditions behind 21, 23, & 25 Peacham Crescent.
* The Factor of Safety (FOS) of 1.3 as requested by TRCA.
* The feasibility, constructability, and cost of each alternative.

Therefore, my answer to the query is: "The key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives include the existing geotechnical conditions behind 21, 23, & 25 Peacham Crescent, the Factor of Safety (FOS) of 1.3 as requested by TRCA, and the feasibility, constructability, and cost of each alternative."
