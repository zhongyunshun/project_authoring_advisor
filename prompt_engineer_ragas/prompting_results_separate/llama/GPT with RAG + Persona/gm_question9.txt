# Answer
To answer the query, we need to examine the documents retrieved and identify patterns or information that relates to the consultation of local Indigenous communities in TRCA projects.

# Identified Information
After reviewing the retrieved passages, I identified some relevant information related to the consultation of local Indigenous communities:

*   In Document 7, there is a list of consulted communities and agencies, including several First Nations.
*   In Document 13, it is mentioned that a full record of Indigenous community consultation can be found in Appendix D.
*   In Document 14, it is stated that TRCA recognizes the importance of consulting with Aboriginal communities on planning matters that may affect their rights and interests.

# Conclusion
Based on the retrieved passages, it appears that TRCA has taken steps to consult with local Indigenous communities in its projects. However, a more detailed examination of the consultation process and its outcomes would be necessary to fully understand the extent of TRCA's engagement with Indigenous communities.
