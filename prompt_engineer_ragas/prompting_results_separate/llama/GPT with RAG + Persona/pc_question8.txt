#### What specific long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies are recommended in the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" to ensure the durability and effectiveness of the implemented slope stabilization measures? ####

The retrieved passage does not mention any specific long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the slope stabilization measures. However, it is mentioned that the project involves:

* Periodic maintenance of the vegetation during the first couple of years until the vegetation becomes well established.
* Installation of proposed concept (MSE Structure) which includes maintenance costs and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) costs to maintain the proposed structure.

Based on this information, it can be inferred that the recommended long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the slope stabilization measures include:

* Periodic maintenance of the vegetation to ensure its continued health and stability.
* Ongoing maintenance and inspection of the MSE Structure to ensure its continued integrity and effectiveness.
