The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf" document addresses potential impacts on biodiversity, particularly in relation to bat species and butternut trees identified in the area.

According to the document, a terrestrial biological survey of the natural area within and surrounding the Project area was undertaken by TRCA's Environmental Monitoring and Data Management (EMDM) in 2018. The survey inventory existing flora, fauna, and habitat features, including bat habitats.

The document also states that due to the presence of a genetically pure butternut tree within the construction access route, the project will provide an opportunity to address drainage and stormwater runoff concerns within the Project limits.

Furthermore, the document outlines measures to minimize impacts on existing vegetation and excess soil removal. The selected alternative provides opportunities for addressing drainage and stormwater runoff concerns.

Overall, the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf" document demonstrates a comprehensive approach to addressing potential impacts on biodiversity, particularly in relation to bat species and butternut trees identified in the area.
