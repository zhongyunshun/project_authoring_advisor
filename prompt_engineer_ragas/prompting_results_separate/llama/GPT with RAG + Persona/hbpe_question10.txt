Based on the retrieved passage and the query delimited by #### characters, I will outline the phased approach for restoring habitats in the Project area.

The HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf document outlines the phased approach as follows:

1.  **Phase I**: The first phase focuses on site preparation and essential wildlife structures. This phase also includes the removal of invasive species within the project area.
2.  **Phases I and II**: The preliminary planting plans have been drafted for Phases I and II. These plans represent a commitment to plant a certain number of trees during final restoration.

The restoration plantings described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" contribute to or mitigate against biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk, by:

1.  Planting native early successional riparian shrub species.
2.  Providing a vegetated buffer to reduce anthropogenic disturbance between the watercourse and public path.

These restoration efforts will help to maintain or increase local biodiversity and support the naturalization of the local ecosystem.
