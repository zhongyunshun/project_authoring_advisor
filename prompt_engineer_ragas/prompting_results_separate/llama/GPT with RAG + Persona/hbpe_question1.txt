# Answer
The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is divided into multiple phases, each with specific timelines. The available document focuses on Phase I, which includes the western armourstone headland and the eastern armourstone headland.

In this phase, the project involves the construction of a temporary culvert and access bridge near the pond outlet. Additionally, staging and stockpiling areas will be established, and required trees will be removed.

The detailed design for the western armourstone headland and the eastern armourstone headland is outlined in this report. The original scope of work has been split into 3 phases. This report details Phase 1, which includes the western armourstone headland and the eastern armourstone headland.

Phase 2 will include the detailed design for the southern headland, and Phase 3 will include the concrete rubble and gravel beach.

The project involves multiple stakeholders, including the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), Shoreplan Engineering Limited, and various contractors. The project requires careful planning and coordination to ensure that all phases are completed on time and within budget.

Overall, the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is a complex and multifaceted undertaking that requires careful planning, coordination, and execution to achieve its goals and objectives.
