#### Are there any future plans or subsequent phases mentioned within the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope at Peacham Crescent? ####

After reviewing the documents, it appears that there are no explicit mentions of future plans or subsequent phases for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope.

However, some general statements and references to potential future work can be found:

- In Document 5 (Page 16), it is mentioned that "the presence of a public footpath at the base of slope; and... the presence of potentially impacted infrastructure located within the tributary and surrounding area."
- In Document 11 (Page 33), it is mentioned that "a risk to park users" due to the unstable slope.

While these statements suggest potential concerns or risks associated with the project, they do not explicitly mention future plans or subsequent phases for further slope stabilization efforts.
