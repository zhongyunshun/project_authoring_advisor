To answer the query, I'll need to search through the retrieved passages and identify relevant information related to wildlife protection in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project.

After searching through the passages, I found the following relevant information:

* In Document 1 (Table 2), it is mentioned that "Aquatic Inventory and Habitat Complete" with three monitoring stations used.
* In Document 5 (Project Brief), it is mentioned that "Prior to the start of construction, staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated with standard silt socks to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse."
* In Document 7 (Aquatic Habitat Components), it is mentioned that discussions are underway between TRCA, DFO, City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design.
* In Document 12 (Tree protection barriers will be erected where necessary...), it is mentioned that tree protection barriers will be erected where necessary to prevent damage to trees during construction.

Based on this information, I can conclude that measures are being taken in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project to ensure the protection and minimal disruption of local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory. These measures include:

* Isolating staging and stockpiling areas with standard silt socks to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse.
* Erecting tree protection barriers where necessary to prevent damage to trees during construction.

Overall, these measures aim to minimize the impact of the project on local wildlife and ensure that the implemented works are stable and performing as designed.
