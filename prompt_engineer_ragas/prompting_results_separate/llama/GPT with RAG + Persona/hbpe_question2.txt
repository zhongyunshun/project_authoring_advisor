Based on the provided documents, the shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" impact the local wildlife, particularly the aquatic species mentioned in the baseline inventory section.

The project involves construction activities that may alter or destroy aquatic habitats. The areas of fish habitat that would be altered or lost as a result of the construction were evaluated in plan view to calculate these areas.

Specifically, the project impacts include:

* Alteration and loss of fish habitats
* Potential contamination of native material composition of the shoreline

To mitigate these impacts, the project includes measures such as:

* Surcharged revetment installation
* Aquatic habitat feature installation
* Compensatory planting plan to restore affected areas.

Overall, the shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" aim to balance the need for maintenance and restoration with the potential impacts on local wildlife.
