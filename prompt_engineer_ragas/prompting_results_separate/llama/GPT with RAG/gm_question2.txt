#### Measures for Protection and Minimal Disruption of Local Wildlife:
The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project has implemented various measures to protect local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory.

1.  **Aquatic Habitat Features:** Discussions are underway with TRCA, DFO, City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design.
2.  **Tree Protection Barriers:** Tree protection barriers will be erected where necessary to protect trees from damage during construction.
3.  **Disturbed Areas Restoration:** All disturbed areas are to be restored to existing conditions or better after construction activities have been completed.
4.  **Post-Construction Monitoring:** The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter to ensure that the implemented works are stable and performing as designed.

These measures demonstrate a commitment to minimizing the impact of construction activities on local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory.
