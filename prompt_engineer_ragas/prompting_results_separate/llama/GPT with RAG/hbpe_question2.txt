#### The shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" do not appear to have a significant impact on local wildlife, particularly aquatic species.

The project brief mentions that the project does not include any in-water work and does not correspond with any Environmental Monitoring and Data Management (EMDM) Regional Watershed Monitoring Program stations. This suggests that the project is designed to minimize impacts on the environment and local wildlife.

However, it is worth noting that the project does involve some construction activities that may potentially impact local wildlife. For example, the project brief mentions that the project will involve the installation of a surcharged revetment, which may potentially impact aquatic habitat.

Overall, while the shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" do not appear to have a significant impact on local wildlife, it is still important for the project proponents to continue to monitor and assess the potential impacts of the project on local wildlife.

It's also worth noting that the project brief mentions that the project will involve some preliminary restoration along the Eastern Headland (seeding and trail repairs) following completion of Phase II. This suggests that the project proponents are taking steps to restore and enhance the environment, which is a positive development for local wildlife.
