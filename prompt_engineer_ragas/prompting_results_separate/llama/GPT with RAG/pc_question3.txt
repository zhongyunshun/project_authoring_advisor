#### Strategies to promote sustainable development and conservation throughout the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project:

1.  **Restoration Plan**: A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented to minimize impacts on existing vegetation and excess soil removal.
2.  **Sediment Control Measures**: Sediment control measures, such as standard sediment control fencing, will be implemented to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse.
3.  **Erosion and Erosion Control Measures**: The project plan outlines erosion and erosion control measures that will be implemented to mitigate erosion hazards and minimize impacts on existing vegetation.

These strategies demonstrate a commitment to sustainable development and conservation throughout the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project.
