#### Environmental and Social Impacts of the Slope Stabilization Project:

The slope stabilization project is proposed to address erosion and slope instability hazards impacting the Project site. The anticipated environmental and social impacts of the project include:

1.  **Loss of Natural Habitat:**** The project may result in the loss of natural habitat within the Project limits.
2.  **Disruption of Riparian Uses:**** The project may disrupt riparian uses, such as fishing or boating, within the Project limits.
3.  **Impact on Wildlife Populations:**** The project may impact wildlife populations, such as birds or small mammals, within the Project limits.
4.  **Loss of Recreational or Tourist Uses:**** The project may result in the loss of recreational or tourist uses, such as hiking or fishing, within the Project limits.

The "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" proposes to address these impacts through various mitigation measures, including:

1.  **Conducting a Comprehensive Restoration Plan:**** The plan will ensure that any areas affected by the project are restored to their natural state.
2.  **Minimizing Impacts on Natural Habitat:**** The project will be designed to have the smallest construction footprint as possible and occur outside of key migration and breeding windows when habitat use is not as crucial.
3.  **Implementing Mitigation Measures for Disruption of Riparian Uses:**** The project will implement measures to minimize disruption to riparian uses, such as fishing or boating.
4.  **Conducting Monitoring and Evaluation to Ensure Compliance with Regulations and Mitigation Measures:**** The project will conduct regular monitoring and evaluation to ensure that the mitigation measures are effective in minimizing impacts on the environment.

By implementing these mitigation measures, the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" aims to minimize the environmental and social impacts of the slope stabilization project.
