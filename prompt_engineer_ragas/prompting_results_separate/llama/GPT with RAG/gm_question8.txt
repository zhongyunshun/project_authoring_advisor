#### The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects like the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project include:

1.  **Post-Construction Monitoring**: Regular inspections will be conducted during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter to ensure that the implemented works are stable and performing as designed.
2.  **Maintenance Requirements**: Any maintenance required will be identified through regular monitoring and inspections, and addressed promptly to prevent damage or deterioration of the erosion control measures.
3.  **Long-term Performance Monitoring**: The long-term performance of the erosion control measures will be monitored through regular inspections and assessments, to ensure that they continue to perform as designed and intended.

These strategies are outlined in various project documents, including the Concept Brief, Project Brief, and Detailed Design Report.
