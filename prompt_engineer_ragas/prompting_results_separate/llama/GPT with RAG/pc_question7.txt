#### Based on the "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final", what were the key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives? ####

Based on Document 6, the key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives include:

1. The site location and its proximity to permanent and essential structures.
2. The presence of a public footpath at the base of the slope.
3. The potential impact on existing infrastructure located within the tributary and surrounding area.

These factors were likely considered in conjunction with other evaluation criteria set out by COâ€™s Class EA for Remedial Flood and Erosion Control to identify the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternative.
