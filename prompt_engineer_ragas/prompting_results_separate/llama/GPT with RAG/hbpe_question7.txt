#### Based on the Concept Brief, the erosion control structures were chosen based on their effectiveness in mitigating erosion and protecting the shoreline. 

The armourstone headlands (e.g., WF11.10) were selected for their ability to protect against wave action and erosion. The armourstone was placed to create a stable structure that could withstand the forces of waves and water.

The gravel beaches (e.g., WF11.11) were chosen for their ability to provide a natural barrier against erosion. The gravel beach was designed to be able to withstand the forces of waves and water, while also providing a natural habitat for plants and animals.

Overall, the selection of these erosion control structures was based on their effectiveness in protecting the shoreline and mitigating erosion.
