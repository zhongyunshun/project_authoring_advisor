#### Are there any future plans or subsequent phases mentioned within the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope at Peacham Crescent? ####

After analyzing the documents, it appears that there are no explicit mentions of future plans or subsequent phases for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope at Peacham Crescent.

However, Document 12 (Class EA Project Plan: Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project) mentions a "potential for future instability" on page 12. While this does not explicitly mention future plans or subsequent phases, it could be interpreted as a potential area of focus in the future.

Overall, while there are no explicit mentions of future plans or subsequent phases for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project scope at Peacham Crescent, it is possible that such efforts may be considered in the future based on ongoing monitoring and assessment.
