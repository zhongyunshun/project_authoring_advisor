#### In the "Design Brief - Phase II" document, what specific engineering challenges and considerations were addressed during the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East? ####

Based on the provided documents, the following specific engineering challenges and considerations were addressed during the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East:

1. **Wave Overtopping**: The overtopping rate was estimated using the methods for armoured slopes and walls presented in the Overtopping Manual (EurOtop, 2018).

2. **Surcharged Revetment**: Habitat features were installed as part of Phase I, consisting of surcharged stone at the base of the revetment at several points along the deepest part of the structure.

3. **Design Considerations and Construction Costs**: The detailed design process considered various factors, including wave overtopping, surcharged revetment, and design considerations and construction costs for Phases 2 and 3.

4. **Aquatic Habitat Alteration & Loss**: It was assumed that the native material composition of the shoreline had potential to be contaminated and therefore the protection structures were designed to minimize cutting and disturbing of native material.

5. **Coastal Assessment**: The detailed design report included a coastal assessment, which involved evaluating various factors, including water levels, wave overtopping, and other relevant considerations.

6. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: The project brief for Phase II included erosion and sediment control measures, such as installing silt socks to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse.

7. **Survey Requirements**: A layout survey was conducted prior to the beginning of implementation and as needed throughout the project to facilitate construction. As-built surveys may be required throughout the implementation process to ensure that the work is being carried out in accordance with the approved plans and specifications.

8. **Construction Access, Staging, and Stockpiling**: The project brief for Phase I included construction access, staging, and stockpiling requirements, such as establishing staging/stockpiling areas, removing required trees, relocating bird nesting boxes within the staging area, and installing ESC measures, tree protection, and site perimeter control.

These are some of the specific engineering challenges and considerations that were addressed during the detailed design process for shoreline protection at Humber Bay Park East.
