#### The specified tree removals and restoration plantings in projects like the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project contribute to or mitigate against biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk such as bats and butternut trees, by:

1.  **Identifying and protecting species at risk**: The project aims to protect and conserve species at risk, such as bats and butternut trees. This is achieved through the implementation of measures to minimize impacts on these species.

2.  **Minimizing tree removals**: The project aims to minimize tree removals, particularly for mature or rare species. This is achieved through careful planning and identification of alternative solutions that minimize tree removals.

3.  **Restoring native vegetation**: The project involves the restoration of native vegetation in areas where trees have been removed or degraded. This is achieved through the planting of native tree species and the establishment of native vegetation communities.

4.  **Compensating for biodiversity loss**: The project involves compensatory measures to mitigate against biodiversity loss resulting from tree removals. These measures include the creation of new habitats, the restoration of degraded habitats, and the translocation of species to new locations.

Overall, the specified tree removals and restoration plantings in projects like the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project contribute to or mitigate against biodiversity loss by minimizing impacts on species at risk and restoring native vegetation.
