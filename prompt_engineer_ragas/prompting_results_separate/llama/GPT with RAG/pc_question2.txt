#### In light of the findings from the Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, what specific measures are proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, especially concerning species identified in the vicinity? ####

After reviewing the documents provided, there is limited information regarding specific measures to mitigate impacts on local wildlife. However, it can be inferred from Document 4 that a comprehensive restoration plan will be developed to minimize impacts on existing vegetation and restore the ecosystem.

Additionally, Document 18 mentions that construction activities will only occur outside of the bird breeding window, which suggests some level of consideration for mitigating impacts on local wildlife.

However, without more specific information regarding measures to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive answer.
