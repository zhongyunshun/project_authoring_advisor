#### Restoration Plantings and Biodiversity

The restoration plantings described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" are intended to contribute to or mitigate against biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk.

According to Document 3, the preliminary plan for Phase I involves the on-site planting of 280 trees whose approximate locations are shown. This will help to restore the local habitat through the planting of suitable native species.

In addition, the restoration plantings will provide increased soil stabilization, reduce surficial erosion, and add to the biodiversity of the local ecosystem once it becomes established.

Therefore, the restoration plantings described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" are expected to contribute positively to biodiversity, particularly concerning species at risk.
