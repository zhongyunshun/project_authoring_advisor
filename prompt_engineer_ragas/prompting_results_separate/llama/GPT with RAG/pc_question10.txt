#### Given the importance of biodiversity conservation, how does the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" address potential impacts on biodiversity, particularly in relation to bat species and butternut trees identified in the area ? ####

The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity by:

1.  Identifying a Category 2 butternut tree within the project area.
2.  Noting that the results of a genetic test determined that the butternut tree is genetically pure and highly susceptible to butternut canker.
3.  Mentioning that post-construction restoration activities will focus on replanting suitable native species to compensate for those that were removed.

However, regarding bat species, there is no specific mention or discussion about potential impacts on bat populations within the project area.

Therefore, while the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" does address potential impacts on biodiversity related to butternut trees, it falls short in addressing potential impacts on bat species within the project area.
