#### After reviewing the documents, I found that several long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies are outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures. Here are some of the key strategies:

1.  Monitoring of erosion control measures: Regular monitoring will be conducted to ensure that the erosion control measures are effective and functioning as designed.
2.  Maintenance of erosion control measures: Maintenance activities will be carried out regularly to ensure that the erosion control measures remain effective and functional.
3.  Replacement of damaged or defective erosion control measures: Damaged or defective erosion control measures will be replaced promptly to ensure that the measures continue to function effectively.
4.  Long-term monitoring of water levels and flow rates: Long-term monitoring of water levels and flow rates will be conducted to ensure that the erosion control measures are effective in preventing erosion and sedimentation.
5.  Regular inspections of erosion control structures: Regular inspections will be carried out to ensure that the erosion control structures are functioning effectively and that any damage or defects are promptly repaired.

These long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies will help to ensure that the newly installed erosion control measures continue to function effectively and that the risks associated with erosion and sedimentation are minimized.
