suitable native species . The planted vegetation will provide increased soil stabilization, reduce surficial 
erosion, and add to the biodiversity of the local ecosystem once it becomes established. Unfortunately, it 
will be necessary for the regraded slope to blend into the rear yards of 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent, 
effectively pushing the slope crest back towards the dwellings and reducing the amount of useable...

Wildlife Populations 
There are no significant wildlife populations identified within the Project limits; therefore, there are no 
anticipated impacts resulting from the proposed works. 
Wetlands 
There were two wetland vegetation communities observed along the southern limits of the Project area,...

Buckthorn are recognized (e.g. wildlife habitat, water quality, carbon sequestration), an ecological gain from the perspective of improving native species representation is expected once restoration plantings of native species are established. Tree removal numbers should be determined during detailed design to include construction-related disturbances and plan any refin
