4.3.5.2 Effects on Coastal Processes 
The new revetment structures planned for Phase 2 of this project are placed on the same footprint 
as the existing revetment structures and therefore have a minimal impact on local coastal 
processes. 
4.3.5.3  Stone Sizing 
Armour stone sizes were selected for stability using the Hudson equation and using the design 
coastal conditions detailed in Section 3 for design input. 
4.3.5.4 Cut and Fill Volumes...

stabilize and prevent further erosion of the shoreline in that area.

Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project – Concept Brief 
Toronto and Region Conservation Authority    |    17 
In general, smaller cobble sizes will offer a more user-friendly beach environment for park users than larger stone, 
but more material will be required to sufficiently protect the shoreline. Treatments using smaller cobble  will 
therefore have higher costs and a greater in -water footprint as well as greater potential  for maintenance needs...

have been undermined due to the ongoing erosion. 
The shoreline is currently protected by armour stone revetment structures. The size of the armour 
stones, the crest elevations and the nature of placement of the armour stones varies considerably. 
The armour stone sizes are most commonly in the 2 to 4 tonne range but larger stones up to 6 
tonnes, and some even larger ones, were found on the site. High water levels experienced...

4.2.5.4 Cut and Fill Volumes  
Cutting into the bank was  minimized during the design process to avoid exposing potential 
contaminated material.  Additional fill material will be required behind the crest of the new 
revetment structures to tie into existing grades. Phase 1 will include, in addition to stone materials...

as the neighbourhood evolves into a denser, high-rise residential community. 
Erosion control structures, including headlands and beaches, were built in the early 1980s in order to protect the 
shoreline. Toronto and Region Conservation Authority’s (TRCA) Er osion Risk Management Program (ERMP)  has 
monitored these structures on an annual basis  since 2006. Both the western armourstone headland (WF 11.10)...

 WF11.11 – Cobble/Rubble Beach 
The concept designs for the beach call for placement of fill over the existing profile of the beach (Figure 19). Four 
alternative options were proposed  for the beach treatment which  vary based on the cobble size and required 
quantity, ranging from 10 to 100 mm diameter stone (Figure 20). Profile details of the
