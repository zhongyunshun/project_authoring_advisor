9 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL MEASURES 
Prior to the start of construction, staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated with standard silt socks to prevent 
the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse, as shown previously Figure 27. All barriers will be...

GENERAL CONSTRUCTION NOTES:SECTION 1: SITE MANAGEMENT1)Erosion and sediment control (ESC) measures will be implemented prior to, and maintained during the construction phases, to prevent entry of sediment into the water. All damaged erosion and sediment control measures should be repaired and/or replaced within 48 hours of the inspection.2)Disturbed areas will be minimized to the extent possible, and temporarily or permanently stabilized or restored as the work progresses.3)The erosion and...

restored as the work progresses.3)The erosion and sediment control strategies outlined on the plans are not static and may need to be upgraded/amended as site conditions change to minimize sediment laden runoff from leaving the work areas. If the prescribed measures on the plans are not effective in preventing the release of deleterious substance, including sediment, then alternative measures must be implemented immediately to minimize potential ecological impacts.

4.0 Monitoring 
PreͲconstruction  and  postͲconstruction  erosion  monitoring  of  the  proposed  works  should  be 
implemented including a record of photographs.  Monitoring of proposed vegetation should also be 
conducted for two (2) years after planting to ensure survivability.  The monitoring activities should 
include (but not limited to): ...

Detailed Scope of Work 
The overall approach to the designs was to prioritize long-term resiliency while reducing the need for excavation 
and off -site disposal to limit disturbance and impacts of the construction activities  as well as addressing the 
leading erosion conc erns of the park, including low crest elevation and wave overtopping. The desig ns address 
these concerns by placing new material over the existing structures where toe and slope stability permits thereby...
