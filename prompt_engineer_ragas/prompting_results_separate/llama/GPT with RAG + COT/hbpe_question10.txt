previously noted, habitat disturbance within the Project limits will be mitigated through a comprehensive 
restoration plan, which will focus on rebuilding the local habitat through the planting of suitable native 
species and ultimately help to create a more robust local environment. 
Significant Vegetation Communities 
There are twelve different types of vegetation communities that exist within, or extend into, the Project...

heavy machinery within the Project limits, the impacts resulting from the proposed works on the  
aforementioned species of concern will be minimal; tree or shrub removals will be planned and highly 
selective. Additionally, post -construction restoration activities will focus on replanting suitable native 
species to compensate for those that were removed and enhance the overall biodiversity of the Project...

Phase I to allow for public access to a portion of the park. Until this final restoration plan is developed, 
preliminary planting plans have been drafted for Phases I and II. These plans represent a commitment to plant a 
certain number of trees during final restoration and will be combined, updated and finalized into the full 
planting plan for the site. 
The Phase I preliminary plan involves the on-site planting of 280 trees whose approximate locations are shown...

main objectives of the proposed works is to enhance naturalization of the Project area. Thus, the proposed 
works will result in the removal of exotic species within the Project limits and additional plantings of 
suitable native species....

Buckthorn are recognized (e.g. wildlife habitat, water quality, carbon sequestration), an ecological gain from the perspective of improving native species representation is expected once restoration plantings of native species are established. Tree removal numbers should be determined during detailed design to include construction-related disturbances and plan any refinements.   At this Conceptual Design phase, approximate percentages of tree removal by species has been calculated based on the...

 Restoration Plantings 
As noted above, a total of 105 trees will need to be removed to facilitate construction. This equals 899 tree units 
to be replaced under TRCA’s 2018 Guideline for Determining Ecosystem Compensation. For this project, six shrubs...

Objective 2 – Naturalization 
The preferred alternative supports the native terrestrial ecosystem habitat by supporting local biodiversity and 
resiliency through the incorporation of native vegetation within the structure design. The face of the MSE 
structure is designed to support the
