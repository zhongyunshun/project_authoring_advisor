addressing the leading erosion concerns of the park , including low crest elevation and wave overtopping.  The 
proposed concepts have been designed to  address these concerns by plac ing new material over the existing 
structures where toe and slope stability permits, thereby minimizing excavation requirements. Two sections have...

along the backshore. This irregular profile places low lying areas at greater risk of flooding  during elevated lake 
levels. Additional stone has been placed in many of the scours to temporarily improve shoreline protection (Figure 
5 and Figure 6), however, these are interim measures only. The western limit of the structure near the transition...

At its eastern limit, the headland  transitions into beach  WF11.11. At this transition point, the concept design 
includes the creation of a berm, consisting of 2-3 tonne armourstone, to create a formal outlet area for the ponds 
(Figure 16 and Figure 17). The elevation of the treatment will be
