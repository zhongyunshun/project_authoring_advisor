The Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project indicates that construction activities will be planned to minimize impacts on local wildlife. Specific measures proposed include:

1. **Minimized Construction Footprint**: All construction activities will be conducted with the aim of having the smallest construction footprint possible to limit disturbances to the existing natural habitat within the project limits.

2. **Timing of Activities**: Construction works are intended to occur outside of key migration and breeding windows, which are critical periods for habitat use by birds and other wildlife, ensuring that breeding activities are not disrupted.

3. **Habitat Restoration Plan**: A comprehensive restoration plan will be developed to enhance and restore affected habitats after construction, which may aid in supporting local wildlife populations in the long term.

4. **Monitoring and Management**: Measures may be put in place for ongoing monitoring of wildlife after the project is completed to assess the impact and effectiveness of the restoration efforts.

To specifically address concerns related to species at risk and ensure the protection of local wildlife, methods to prevent habitat degradation and implement restoration strategies will be emphasized.
