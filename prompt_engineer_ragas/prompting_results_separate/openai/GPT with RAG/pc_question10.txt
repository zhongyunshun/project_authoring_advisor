The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity by outlining specific measures focused on the conservation of identified species, particularly bat species and butternut trees.

1. **Bat Species**: The project brief acknowledges the presence of bat habitat within the project area. It states that appropriate compensation will be coordinated by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authorityâ€™s Environmental Resource Management (ERM) Project staff in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol. This commitment indicates that steps will be taken to minimize disruption to bat populations during the project and to ensure their habitat is preserved.

2. **Butternut Trees**: The brief highlights that a Category 2 butternut tree has been identified along the proposed access route. It notes that this tree is not significantly affected by Butternut Canker, a disease that severely impacts butternut populations. The brief emphasizes the need to manage construction activities carefully, with plans to minimize tree removals and selectivity to ensure the welfare of vegetation communities. This approach aims to reduce the overall impact on the butternut and ensure that any necessary tree removals are conducted judiciously.

In summary, the project brief incorporates biodiversity considerations by detailing plans to mitigate impacts on bat species and butternut trees, ensuring adherence to relevant conservation guidelines and principles.
