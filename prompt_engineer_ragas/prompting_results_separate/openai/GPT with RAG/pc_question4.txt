The retrieved passage does not explicitly detail the defined roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the Class Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project. However, it does mention the involvement of various parties, such as the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities. 

The stakeholders likely include:

1. **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA)**: Responsible for managing the project, conducting assessments, and ensuring compliance with the Class EA process.
2. **Community Groups and Homeowners**: Engaged in the project through public notifications and consultations to provide input and feedback.
3. **Indigenous Communities**: Included in the consultation process, ensuring their interests and concerns are addressed.

For specific roles and responsibilities, further details would generally be found within the project's full documentation, particularly during the public consultation phases and in project planning meetings, which outline how stakeholders interact and contribute to the project.
