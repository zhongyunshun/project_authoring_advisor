The erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park aims to address potential social impacts by incorporating public safety considerations and enhancing the recreational usability of the park. The German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project prepares measures to mitigate risks associated with erosion that could impact access to parklands and recreational spaces. 

1. **Safety Features**: The project includes designing safety features such as fencing to protect park users from potential hazards posed by erosion, thereby improving public safety (Document 7).

2. **Infrastructure Protection**: The primary objective of the project is to protect sanitary infrastructure at risk due to erosion. By ensuring the integrity of sewer lines and other infrastructure, the project aims to maintain normal access and usability of recreational areas within the park (Document 5, Document 18).

3. **Environmental Assessment**: The project involves conducting an environmental assessment to evaluate alternatives that would include enhancing the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic habitats while preserving public enjoyment of the natural space (Document 3, Document 17).

4. **Community Engagement**: The management plans may involve engaging with the local community to gather feedback and comments on project concepts and their impact on park access and recreational opportunities (Document 3).

5. **Restoration Opportunities**: The planned works also aim to provide long-term solutions that not only address erosion control but also offer opportunities to improve aquatic and terrestrial habitats, which may indirectly enhance recreational experiences within the park (Document 18, Document 12).

Overall, the management strategy is multi-faceted, focusing on environmental sustainability while ensuring that the social needs for access and recreational enjoyment are met.
