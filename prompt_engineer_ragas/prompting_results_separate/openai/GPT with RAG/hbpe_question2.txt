The shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" are expected to have various impacts on local wildlife, particularly the aquatic species mentioned in the baseline inventory section. Here are the key points regarding these impacts:

1. **Aquatic Habitat Alteration**: The construction activities associated with the maintenance project may alter existing aquatic habitats. The baseline inventory notes that alterations could lead to the loss of fish habitats due to the construction of structures such as revetments and groins. The evaluation of the proposed structures aims to calculate the areas of fish habitat that may be impacted.

2. **Baseline Inventory Findings**: The project brief highlights the presence of several aquatic species, such as Alewives, White Suckers, Rainbow Smelt, and others. The monitoring stations indicated that these species are commonly found in the area. The proposed construction activities may disrupt their habitats, affecting their population dynamics and overall health.

3. **Mitigation Measures**: As highlighted in the project brief, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) has implemented mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts during construction. This includes adhering to best management practices, isolating staging and stockpiling areas, and using erosion and sediment control measures to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse.

4. **Investment in Habitat Features**: The project incorporates the installation of aquatic habitat features as part of its design, which may provide benefits to local aquatic species. These habitat features aim to enhance the ecological conditions of the area by providing additional shelter and breeding grounds for fish and other aquatic organisms.

5. **Long-Term Monitoring and Restoration**: Following the completion of the construction phases, there will be site restoration and monitoring to ensure that the impacts on local wildlife are assessed and adequately addressed. This includes implementing a planting plan to restore vegetation and improve habitat conditions.

In summary, while the shoreline maintenance projects may pose risks to local wildlife and aquatic species through habitat alteration and potential loss, the inclusion of mitigation strategies and habitat enhancement initiatives aims to balance these impacts and support the ecological integrity of Humber Bay Park East.
