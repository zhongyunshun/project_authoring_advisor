The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for the erosion control measures in projects like the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project include regular inspections and monitoring of the site. Specifically, the site will be inspected during the first year following major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter. This is to ensure that the implemented works are stable and performing as designed. Any required maintenance will be addressed as needed based on these assessments. This strategy aims to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of the erosion control structures over time.
