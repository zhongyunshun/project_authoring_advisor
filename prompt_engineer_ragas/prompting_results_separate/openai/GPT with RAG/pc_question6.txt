The anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project include concerns related to wildlife habitats, vegetation communities, and public safety. According to the information retrieved from the Class EA Project Plan:

1. **Environmental Impacts**:
   - **Wildlife Habitat**: The assessment indicates no significant wildlife populations within the Project limits, suggesting a LOW impact in this regard (Document 9).
   - **Vegetation Communities**: The project is designed to minimize impacts on existing vegetation and has proposed construction activities that will aim for a minimal footprint, avoiding key migration and breeding windows (Document 18).
   - **Wetlands**: Some wetland vegetation communities were noted, but the project seems aimed at mitigating any potential impacts from construction (Document 9).
   - **Physical Environment**: There are no unique landforms or significant historic canals within the area, which limits potential environmental disruptions (Documents 10 and 22).

2. **Social Impacts**:
   - **Public Safety**: There are potential risks to public safety along trails and slopes, which the project acknowledges. Safety features, such as fences, may be needed to ensure community safety (Document 11).
   - **Community Engagement**: The project includes public notifications and consultations, with notices sent to community groups and local residents to inform them of the project's status and our engagement in the decision-making process (Document 4).

3. **Mitigation Measures**:
   - The project plan emphasizes long-term, low-maintenance protection for the affected properties while seeking to reduce risks to life and property (Document 5).
   - A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented to counteract impacts from construction and ensure ecological recovery (Document 18).
   - The project will adhere to the Class Environmental Assessment process, ensuring a full range of alternatives must be explored and implemented, including stakeholder engagement and feedback (Documents 16 and 15).

In summary, the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" plans to address environmental and social impacts through careful planning, public engagement, and mitigation strategies aimed at minimizing disruption during and post-construction.
