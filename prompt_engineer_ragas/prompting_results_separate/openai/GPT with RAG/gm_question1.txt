The methodology used for the "Slope Stability Analysis" in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project involves a series of assessments and evaluations conducted by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) to understand the causes and extent of erosion and slope instability hazards affecting the project site. Here's a summary of the key components of the methodology and its impact on project decisions:

1. **Data Collection and Site Investigation**: The analysis begins with a thorough examination of the site, including historical aerial photographs and previous assessments to identify signs of slope instability and erosion. This includes reviewing documentation such as the "Slope Stability & Erosion Risk Assessment" from Cole Engineering and other prior studies.

2. **Geotechnical Assessments**: The methodology involves conducting geotechnical investigations, which may include borehole drilling, soil sampling, and laboratory testing of soil properties. These assessments are crucial for determining the soil composition, moisture content, shear strength, and overall stability of the slopes.

3. **Modeling and Analysis**: The TRCA uses computational models to simulate slope conditions and assess the factor of safety against potential failure. This includes determining the location of the projected long-term stable slope crest (LTSSC) and its relationship to existing infrastructure and natural features.

4. **Identification of Risks**: The analysis helps identify various risks associated with slope failures, such as impacts on surrounding properties, public safety, and potential damage to infrastructure. This step is critical for prioritizing intervention measures.

5. **Mitigation Strategies**: Based on the findings from the slope stability analysis, the TRCA recommends various remediation and erosion control strategies. This may involve structural solutions like retaining walls, drainage systems, and vegetation stabilization methods to enhance slope resilience.

6. **Public Safety Considerations**: The methodology assesses potential risks to public safety, particularly concerning footpaths and infrastructure located at the base of slopes. It emphasizes the importance of implementing appropriate safety measures during and after construction.

### Impact on Project Decisions:

- **Informed Decision-Making**: The detailed analysis provides a scientific basis for decision-making, allowing stakeholders to choose the most effective mitigation measures based on actual site conditions rather than assumptions.

- **Prioritization of Interventions**: Understanding the specific stability issues helps prioritize areas that require immediate attention, ultimately optimizing resource allocation for remediation efforts.

- **Compliance and Approvals**: The findings from the slope stability analysis support compliance with regulatory requirements and provide necessary documentation for obtaining approvals from relevant authorities.

- **Long-term Planning**: The analysis contributes to developing a long-term maintenance and monitoring plan, ensuring the stability of the slopes is preserved and minimizing the likelihood of future erosion or instability incidents.

In summary, the "Slope Stability Analysis" methodology is fundamental to the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, as it establishes the foundation for understanding the site conditions, risks, and effective strategies for ensuring safety and sustainability.
