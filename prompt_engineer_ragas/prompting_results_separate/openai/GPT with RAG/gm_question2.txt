The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several measures to protect and minimize disruption to local wildlife, particularly aquatic species. Here are the key actions outlined in the documents:

1. **Baseline Inventory**: A thorough baseline inventory was conducted to document existing conditions and identify the aquatic species present, helping to target conservation efforts. Common species found include Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt.

2. **Archaeological and Aquatic Inventory Assessments**: The project underwent Archaeological Assessments (Stages 1 and 2) and Aquatic Inventory assessments to understand potential impacts and guide mitigation strategies.

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Prior to construction, standard sediment control measures such as silt socks will be installed at staging and stockpiling areas. This aims to prevent deleterious substances from entering watercourses, thereby safeguarding aquatic life.

4. **Construction Practices**: The design of protection structures along the shoreline was carefully considered to minimize cutting and disturbance to native materials. This is crucial for maintaining the habitats of local aquatic species.

5. **Aquatic Habitat Features Development**: Collaborations are underway between the Toronto Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), and other stakeholders to develop aquatic habitat features, such as revetments that are designed to enhance natural habitats.

6. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After implementation, the site will undergo annual inspections and checks after major storm events to ensure stability and functionality of the implemented measures, further protecting local wildlife.

These strategies reflect a comprehensive approach to balancing construction needs with wildlife protection in the Humber Bay Park East area.
