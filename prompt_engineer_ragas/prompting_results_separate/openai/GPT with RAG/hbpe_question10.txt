The restoration plantings described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" contribute to mitigating biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk, through several key actions:

1. **Native Species Planting**: The restoration plan emphasizes the planting of suitable native species, which helps to restore the ecosystem's natural balance. Native plants are crucial for providing habitat and food sources for local wildlife, including species at risk.

2. **Replacement for Removed Vegetation**: The plan accounts for the anticipated removal of trees and shrubs by committing to replace a specific number of these with new plantings (e.g., the preliminary plan mentions planting 280 trees). This replacement is crucial in maintaining habitat continuity for species that may be affected by the removal of vegetation.

3. **Enhancement of Local Biodiversity**: By focusing on the replanting of native species, the restoration efforts enhance the overall biodiversity of the area. Native vegetation supports a wider range of local wildlife, thereby benefiting species at risk that depend on these plants for survival.

4. **Habitat Improvement**: The works aim to enhance habitat quality and connectivity within the Project area. This is critical for the survival of species at risk, as improved habitat linkages can facilitate movement and access to resources necessary for their survival.

5. **Reduction of Exotic Species**: The project includes the removal of invasive and exotic species, which often outcompete native flora. By controlling these species, the restoration plantings help to improve the ecological conditions for native plants and the wildlife that relies on them.

Overall, these restoration activities are designed not only to replace vegetation lost due to project activities but also to create a more resilient and biodiverse ecosystem that supports at-risk species effectively.
