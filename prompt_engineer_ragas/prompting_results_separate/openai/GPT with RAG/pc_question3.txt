The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" outlines several strategies to promote sustainable development and conservation in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project. These include:

1. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: The project includes isolation of the work area with standard sediment control fencing to prevent harmful substances from entering the watercourse. Regular inspections and maintenance of these barriers are mandated throughout the construction duration to maintain their effectiveness.

2. **Habitat Protection**: The project aims to minimize impacts on existing natural habitats within the project limits. Construction activities are planned to have the smallest possible footprint and to occur outside of key migration and breeding periods, ensuring that the ecological integrity of the area is preserved.

3. **Restoration Plan**: A comprehensive restoration plan is in place to address any disturbances caused by construction activities. This plan likely includes replanting native species and restoring natural habitats to support local biodiversity.

4. **Detailed Design Brief References**: The project brief refers to a detailed design plan (Terraprobe, 2020), which likely contains additional recommendations and strategies for responsible and sustainable design practices.

5. **Utility Management**: The brief includes an overview of subsurface utility locates, ensuring that underground infrastructure is appropriately managed during the project to mitigate disruption and potential environmental damage.

These strategies reflect the projectâ€™s commitment to sustainable practices while addressing the immediate need for slope stabilization and erosion control.
