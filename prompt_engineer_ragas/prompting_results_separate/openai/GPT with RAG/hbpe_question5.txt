The future phases planned for Humber Bay Park East, as mentioned in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II," include:

1. **Phase I**: This phase has already been initiated and involved various preparatory actions such as site setup, including establishment of staging areas and removal of trees.

2. **Phase II**: Currently focuses on the Western Headland and includes a scope of work involving major maintenance efforts, including restoration plantings and site restoration following the completion of this phase.

3. **Phase III**: This phase is anticipated to involve the placement of beach material that will be positioned to the east of the structure as part of the broader shoreline management and maintenance efforts.

Overall, the project is structured in three distinct phases for design and implementation, aimed at enhancing the shoreline and ensuring long-term sustainability of the park.
