The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" include:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will be inspected annually and after major storm events during the first year to ensure stability and performance of the installed works. Any necessary maintenance will be performed as indicated in Document 1.

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Erosion control measures will be implemented prior to construction and maintained throughout the construction phases. This includes repairing or replacing any damaged erosion and sediment control measures within 48 hours (Document 5).

3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular monitoring by trained professionals will be conducted during construction to ensure that best management practices are adhered to, minimizing disturbances to the environment. Any defective erosion and sediment control measures will be repaired promptly (Document 15).

4. **Site Restoration and Monitoring**: Following construction, monitoring activities will include the restoration of impaired function of the natural system and implementation of restoration plantings. Monitoring of vegetation survivability will occur for two years after planting (Document 9, Document 7).

These strategies collectively emphasize the importance of ongoing evaluation and adjustment of erosion control measures to mitigate long-term risks associated with erosion and sedimentation.
