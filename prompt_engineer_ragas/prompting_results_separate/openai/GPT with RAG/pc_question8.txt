The retrieved documents do not specify detailed long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies recommended in the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" for ensuring the durability and effectiveness of the implemented slope stabilization measures. However, based on standard practices for slope stabilization projects, long-term monitoring may typically include:

1. **Regular Inspections**: Conduct periodic assessments of the slope stability and erosion control measures to identify any signs of distress or failure.
   
2. **Maintenance of Vegetation**: Implement a vegetation management plan that includes periodic maintenance of the planted vegetation during the first few years to ensure it becomes well-established and effective in preventing erosion.

3. **Structural Maintenance**: Ensure that any installed structures, like retaining walls or drainage systems, are inspected and maintained to fulfill their intended function without deterioration.

4. **Monitoring of Water Management**: Assess and maintain drainage systems to prevent water accumulation that might lead to soil erosion or instability.
