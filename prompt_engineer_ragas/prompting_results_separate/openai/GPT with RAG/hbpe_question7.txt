In the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief," the selection of different erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and gravel beaches, was guided by their effectiveness in addressing shoreline stability and their environmental impact. 

1. **Effectiveness**: The brief discusses the condition and performance of existing structures, such as the armourstone headlands (WF11.10 and WF11.12) and cobble/gravel beaches (WF11.11). The evaluation included observations of structural stability, scouring, and displacement of materials. For example, the condition of the eastern armourstone headland showed visible material displacement and erosion, indicating a need for maintenance and potentially new designs that enhance stability (Documents 2, 3, and 22). The proposals aimed to address low crest elevation and wave overtopping, which were identified as significant concerns for erosion control.

2. **Environmental Impact**: The designs were also informed by the need to minimize disturbance to the native material and to preserve aquatic habitats. For instance, the brief highlights that structures were designed to minimize cutting and disruption of existing conditions, thereby considering the environmental implications of construction (Documents 11 and 19). Moreover, the type of material used, such as smaller cobbles for beach treatment, was analyzed for its implications on user-friendliness and costs versus effectiveness in shoreline protection (Document 11). 

Overall, the choice of erosion control structures was a balance between maximizing protective capabilities and minimizing environmental disruption. The concept design included solutions that place new materials strategically over existing structures where stability allows, thus reducing excavation and potential negative environmental impact (Document 5).
