In the development and implementation of Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) projects like those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay, local Indigenous communities are engaged through a process of meaningful and mutually respectful consultation. This engagement takes various forms depending on the community's scope and interests. 

1. **Formal and Informal Partnerships**: TRCA aims to build positive relationships with Indigenous communities, which can involve both informal partnerships in initiatives and formal engagement for projects that are subject to legislative requirements.

2. **Consultation Methods**: Various methods of communication are utilized to inform and involve Indigenous communities, including notices of intent and follow-up communications via courier and email. For instance, for the Peacham Crescent project, the TRCA issued a Notice of Intent and conducted further communications to keep the communities updated on project developments.

3. **Documented Engagement**: TRCA maintains a Record of Indigenous Engagement, which includes a summary of consultations, correspondence, and assessments requested by Indigenous groups, demonstrating a structured approach to documenting interactions and feedback.

4. **Tailored Engagement**: The engagement process considers the unique characteristics of each Indigenous community, allowing them to provide input and voice their concerns regarding how projects may impact their rights and interests. This is especially relevant in areas with overlapping traditional territories and archaeological considerations.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: TRCA recognizes the importance of Indigenous consultation and actively seeks to adapt its engagement strategies to ensure that they are effective and respectful of Indigenous rights and interests.

Overall, the TRCA's approach to consulting local Indigenous communities reflects a commitment to inclusivity and respect for Indigenous heritage and stakeholders in the planning processes of their projects.
