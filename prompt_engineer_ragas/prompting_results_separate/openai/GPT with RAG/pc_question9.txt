Indigenous communities were engaged in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project through a structured consultation process. As outlined in Document 1, a full record of Indigenous community consultations, including all correspondence, is documented in the "Record of Indigenous Engagement" for the project. This information can be found in Appendix D of the related reports.

The project plan indicates that notifications were sent to a variety of Indigenous communities, including but not limited to the Beausoleil First Nation, Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, and Huron-Wendat Nation, among others (Document 3). The first point of public contact occurred with the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018, marking the beginning of public engagement which included Indigenous groups (Document 2).

According to the concerns discussed (Document 19), there have been no major concerns raised by the Indigenous communities regarding the project, suggesting that their engagement was largely affirmative or that they did not find significant issues warranting opposition. Such outcomes imply that the consultation helped address potential concerns early in the project planning, thereby fostering a collaborative approach between the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and the Indigenous communities involved. However, details on the specific outcomes resulting from this engagement, such as changes made to the project or commitments to ongoing collaboration, were not elaborated in the provided documents.
