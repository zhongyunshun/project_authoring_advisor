The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation. Here are some of the key practices based on the provided documents:

1. **Erosion Control**: The project focuses on addressing erosion risks by implementing measures that enhance the stability of the shoreline. This includes the placement of new materials over existing structures to minimize excavation and preserve the natural landscape.

2. **Phased Implementation**: The project is divided into three phases, allowing for a comprehensive approach to design and construction. This phased method enables continuous assessment and adaptation of strategies as the project progresses, ensuring ongoing environmental considerations are met.

3. **Use of Native Materials**: Design practices consider the potential contamination of native shoreline materials. Structures are designed to minimize disturbance of these materials, thereby preserving local ecosystems and maintaining biodiversity.

4. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: There are plans for site inspections following major storm events and on an annual basis to assess the stability of implemented works. This monitoring ensures that any necessary maintenance or adjustments can be made promptly to support long-term sustainability.

5. **Habitat Creation and Restoration**: The project includes components aimed at habitat creation and restoration, such as planting efforts following regrading and seeding activities. This will aid in reestablishing native flora and fauna in the area.

6. **Climate Change Considerations**: The design and planning phases have incorporated research on the expected impacts of climate change, indicating an awareness of shifting environmental conditions. This informs decision-making regarding the resilience of the shoreline and structures.

7. **Community Engagement and Accessibility**: While not detailed in the provided texts, sustainable projects often engage the community for input and awareness, which can include making the park more accessible and user-friendly, thereby promoting environmental stewardship among visitors.

These practices collectively contribute to the project's goal of maintaining the ecological integrity of Humber Bay Park East while addressing the immediate needs of erosion control and infrastructure maintenance.
