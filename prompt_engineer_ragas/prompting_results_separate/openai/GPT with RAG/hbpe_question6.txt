The slope stabilization project on Peacham Crescent incorporates several strategies to address potential social impacts and ensure the safety of the local community:

1. **Public Safety Measures**: The project evaluates potential risks to public safety associated with the slopes, especially along trails and the slope area. It plans to implement safety features, such as safety fences, to mitigate these risks. The estimated impact on public safety is rated as low to moderate, indicating that the risks are acknowledged and being actively managed.

2. **Public Notification and Consultation**: According to the Class EA process, public notification was initiated with a Notice of Intent published on November 22, 2018. This involved reaching out to community groups and homeowners in the vicinity, as well as Indigenous communities. Engaging with the public early in the planning helps to address concerns and involves the community in the decision-making process.

3. **Impact Assessments**: The project includes thorough assessments of the potential effects of slope stabilization on the surrounding community, such as existing tourism operations and property accessibility. It concluded that there would be no impacts from existing tourism operations and proposed access routes to maintain property accessibility behind residences.

4. **Environmental Considerations**: The project seeks to minimize impacts on existing vegetation and address drainage and stormwater runoff concerns, which are important for maintaining the ecological integrity of the area and, by extension, the community's quality of life.

By focusing on these areas, the project aims not only to stabilize the slope but also to ensure that any social impacts are mitigated for the safety and well-being of the local residents.
