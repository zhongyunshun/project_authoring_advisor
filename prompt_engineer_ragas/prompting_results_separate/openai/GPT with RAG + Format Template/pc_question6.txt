The anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project include:

1. **Environmental Impacts:**
   - **Wildlife and Habitat:** There are no significant wildlife populations identified within the Project limits, suggesting minimal ecological disruption. The project plans to minimize impacts on existing natural habitats by ensuring construction activities have the smallest footprint possible and occur outside of key migration and breeding windows (Document 9, page 28; Document 18, page 26).
   - **Vegetation and Soil:** The project will result in less impact on existing vegetation and soil compared to alternative options, addressing drainage and stormwater concerns (Document 8, page 44). Measures have also been proposed to manage excess soil removal responsibly (Document 21, page 21).

2. **Social Impacts:**
   - **Public Safety:** Potential risks to public safety due to the proximity of construction activities to residential areas and public footpaths have been acknowledged. The project includes plans for safety features, such as fences along trails and slopes (Document 11, page 42).
   - **Community Engagement:** The project has taken steps to include public notifications and consultations, initiating contact with community groups and Indigenous communities through a Notice of Intent published on November 22, 2018 (Document 4, page 48).

To address these impacts, the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" outlines various strategies, including:
- Implementing a comprehensive restoration plan to rehabilitate any disturbed areas (Document 18, page 26).
- Enforcing construction practices that limit environmental footprint and maintain existing habitats (Documents 18 and 8).
- Developing alternative solutions that mitigate risks to life and property while complying with regulatory frameworks established under the Conservation Authorities Act (Document 5, page 3).

By taking these steps, the project aims to balance the necessary erosion control measures with environmental stewardship and community safety.
