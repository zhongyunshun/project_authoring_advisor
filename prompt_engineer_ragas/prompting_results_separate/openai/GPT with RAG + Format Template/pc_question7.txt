The "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final" outlines several key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives for the sites located behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent. These factors include:

1. **Feasibility**: Each alternative was assessed for its practical viability in terms of construction and implementation, taking into account the specific site conditions.

2. **Constructability**: The ease or complexity of constructing each alternative was evaluated, including considerations for site access, equipment needs, and the ability to execute the construction without significant disruption.

3. **Cost**: Financial implications were a crucial aspect, with each alternative being analyzed for its estimated costs concerning the budget and financial resources available for the project.

4. **Safety**: Ensuring the safety of the public and site workers during construction and after implementation was paramount in the selection process.

5. **Environmental Impact**: The potential effects of each alternative on the surrounding ecology, particularly regarding vegetation and habitat disruption, were considered.

6. **Regulatory Compliance**: It was essential that the chosen alternatives met the necessary regulatory requirements and guidelines established by oversight authorities like the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA).

These evaluative criteria were instrumental in driving the decision toward the most appropriate stabilization solution to address the slope stability issues effectively (Source: Document 9, Pages 2-3).
