To address your query regarding the long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies recommended in the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" for ensuring the durability and effectiveness of the implemented slope stabilization measures, the following details are pertinent:

1. **Periodic Maintenance of Vegetation**: The project outlines the need for ongoing maintenance of vegetation during the initial couple of years following construction. This is essential to ensure that the vegetation becomes well-established, which is critical for effective slope stabilization (Document 10, page 43).

2. **Inspection and Maintenance of Control Measures**: The work area will be segregated using standard sediment control fencing prior to construction. These barriers will be regularly inspected and maintained throughout the duration of construction and will be kept in place until the site is adequately stabilized (Document 3, page 15).

3. **Assessment of Environmental Impact**: Continuous monitoring will involve assessing the physical and biological impacts of the slope stabilization measures on the local ecosystem, including wildlife habitats and vegetation communities. These assessments will help guide maintenance practices moving forward (Document 5, page 46; Document 9, page 45).

4. **Overall Risk Mitigation and Monitoring**: The project is developed in accordance with ongoing environmental assessments and will include provisions for monitoring to mitigate risks to life and property from slope erosion. These strategies are aligned with the goals of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) under the Conservation Authorities Act (Document 8, page 3).
