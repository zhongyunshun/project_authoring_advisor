The planning and implementation phases of the projects include several specific engagements and consultations with local Indigenous communities. Here are some highlights based on the retrieved documents:

1. **Indigenous Engagement Procedures**: The engagement process is tailored to the specific community and project's scope, allowing Indigenous communities to provide input into the project proposals (Document 1). 

2. **Community Consultation**: Prior to notifying the communities about the project, the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) was consulted to determine relevant Indigenous communities to contact (Document 2). This approach emphasizes a detailed consultation strategy that encompasses formal engagement with Indigenous groups.

3. **Identifying Interested Communities**: Specific Indigenous groups such as the Credit First Nation, Seven Generations Education Institute, and others were identified as having an interest in project developments (Document 3). Consultation records for communities show a systematic approach to ensure all interested parties are notified and engaged (Document 6).

4. **Documentation of Engagement**: Records of consultation, including detailed correspondence with Indigenous communities, are maintained. An example includes the Record of Indigenous Engagement for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, which documents all engagements and ensures transparency (Document 6).

5. **Consultation Dates and Methods**: Various engagement methods have included couriers and emails to deliver notifications and consultation packages to Indigenous communities (Document 9, Document 16). For instance, the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation and other groups received memos summarizing environmental studies related to the project (Document 19).

6. **Ongoing Dialogue**: The communication process not only respects Indigenous cultures and practices but emphasizes the importance of open dialogue, with opportunities for feedback being a consistent aspect of the engagement strategy (Document 4).

In summary, the approach to engaging Indigenous communities is comprehensive, involving pre-consultation with government bodies, targeted outreach, documentation of interactions, and a commitment to respectful and ongoing dialogue.
