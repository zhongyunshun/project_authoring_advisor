The slope stabilization project on Peacham Crescent, as outlined in the Class EA Project Plan, addresses potential social impacts and community safety through a careful assessment of public safety risks and engagement with local residents. 

### Key Measures for Addressing Social Impacts and Ensuring Safety:

1. **Public Safety Assessments**:
   - The project includes evaluations of potential risks to public safety, especially concerning areas like trails and slopes adjacent to the construction site. The anticipated impact on public safety is rated as low to moderate, suggesting proactive measures will be taken to minimize risks (Document 3, page 42).

2. **Public Notifications and Consultation**:
   - The project follows a structured public engagement process, where notifications were sent to community groups, homeowners in the vicinity, and Indigenous communities. The first public notice was published on November 22, 2018, ensuring transparency and gathering community feedback (Document 18, page 48).

3. **Access Management**:
   - To ensure the safety of pedestrians, temporary restrictions on pedestrian traffic along the paved pathways in the parkland corridor will be implemented during construction. This is to prevent accidents while work is being carried out (Document 9, page 36).

4. **Infrastructure Considerations**:
   - The project plans to consider the proximity of existing infrastructure, including paths and residential properties. This planning aims to minimize disturbances and potential impacts on community accessibility and safety (Document 7, page 37).

These measures aim to not only stabilize the slope and mitigate erosion risks but also to enhance community safety and maintain open lines of communication with residents, ensuring that their concerns and needs are addressed throughout the project's lifecycle.
