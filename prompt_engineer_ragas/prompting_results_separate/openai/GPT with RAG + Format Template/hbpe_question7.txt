The decision-making regarding the different erosion control structures in the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief" was based on multiple considerations, including their effectiveness in preventing erosion, environmental impact, and existing site conditions.

1. **Assessment of Existing Structures**: The concept brief outlines the condition of existing erosion control structures, such as various armourstone headlands and gravel beaches, detailing their current state, deficiencies, and overall effectiveness. For instance, the western armourstone headland (WF11.10) was noted to be "failing" but rated as "fair," indicating it had some protective capabilities despite issues like minor displacement of armourstone and scouring from overtopping (Document 3, page 5).

2. **Targeted Design Solutions**: The proposed designs aim to address specific concerns identified during assessments, such as low crest elevation and wave overtopping. The designs include placing new material over existing structures to enhance stability without significant excavation, which minimizes disturbance to the environment (Document 5, page 15). This approach demonstrates a balance between enhancing structural integrity and reducing ecological impact.

3. **Material Considerations**: The concept designs for the beach and headland structures consider varying material types and sizes. For example, smaller cobble sizes were recommended to create a more user-friendly beach environment, although they would require more material and have a higher cost due to increased maintenance needs (Document 11, page 20). 

4. **Environmental Impact**: The project emphasized the importance of minimizing disruptions to native materials and surrounding habitats. It was noted that the existing revetment structures could remain largely intact during repairs, reflecting a commitment to preserving aquatic habitats (Document 19, page 22). 

In conclusion, the selection and design of erosion control structures at Humber Bay Park East were thoughtfully determined based on detailed assessments of existing conditions, targeted structural improvements, material choice, and environmental considerations to effectively manage erosion while protecting the surrounding ecosystem.
