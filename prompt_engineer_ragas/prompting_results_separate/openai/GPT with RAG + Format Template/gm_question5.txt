The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is structured in three phases for design and implementation due to the project's extensive area and multi-year construction timelines. Each phase addresses specific aspects of maintenance and stabilization to protect the shoreline effectively (Document 1).

For the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, while the primary documentation focuses on the current project, it does not explicitly detail future phases or expansions. However, these types of projects typically undergo periodic evaluations, and expansions could be determined based on environmental assessments and ongoing erosion concerns. Document references suggest monitoring and potential adjustments may occur based on the effectiveness of the initial implementations (Document 3 and Document 4).

In summary, while both projects currently have defined phases and a structured approach to maintenance and stabilization, there is no specific mention of planned future expansions in the available documentation. Ongoing assessments may inform any future actions.
