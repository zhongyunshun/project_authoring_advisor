The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation. Here are the key practices highlighted in the retrieved documents:

1. **Erosion Control and Risk Management**: The project focuses on addressing major erosion concerns along the shoreline, particularly through the implementation of erosion control structures. This involves adding new material to existing structures to enhance stability while minimizing excavation needs, which helps maintain the natural landscape (Document 6).

2. **Multi-Phased Implementation**: The project is divided into three phases, allowing for careful design and execution that can adapt to changes and feedback over time. This phased approach also facilitates better monitoring and management of environmental impacts (Documents 3 and 10).

3. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: The project includes provisions for regular inspections after construction, especially following major storm events. This ongoing monitoring will help assess the stability and effectiveness of the implemented works, allowing for timely maintenance when necessary (Document 12, Document 18).

4. **Minimization of Disturbance**: Strategies are in place to minimize disturbances to the native shoreline material during the construction process. This reflects an awareness of the ecological impact and aims to preserve the existing habitat as much as possible (Document 17).

5. **Restoration Plantings**: There is a commitment to restoration activities, which will include regrading and seeding as part of the overall site restoration plan. The full details of the restoration plan will be developed in conjunction with the detailed designs for the final phase of the project (Document 22).

These practices collectively reflect the project's commitment to sustainable development and environmental conservation within the context of the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project.
