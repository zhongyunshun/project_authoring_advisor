The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the erosion control measures in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project includes a structured approach to ensure their stability and performance following installation. According to the documents:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will undergo inspections during the first year following significant storm events and annually thereafter. This is to verify that the erosion control measures are stable and functioning as intended (Document 1, Document 2).

2. **Restoration Plantings**: For Phase I, site restoration efforts will involve regrading and seeding. A more comprehensive Restoration Plan will be developed as part of the detailed designs for the project's final phase (Document 17).

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: The project also incorporates measures to prevent sediment and contaminants from entering the watercourse during construction, such as the use of silt socks in staging and stockpiling areas (Document 9, Document 13).

These strategies are part of a broader project framework aimed at managing erosion risks and ensuring the longevity of the implemented structures. If you require more specific details about any aspect of the monitoring and maintenance strategies, feel free to ask!
