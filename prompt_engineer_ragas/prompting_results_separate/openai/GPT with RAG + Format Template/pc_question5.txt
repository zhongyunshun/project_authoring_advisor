The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" does not explicitly mention any future plans or subsequent phases for further slope stabilization efforts beyond the current project. The document primarily outlines the scope of the existing Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, focusing on the immediate remediation works planned to address the slope instability affecting the properties at 21, 23, 25, and 27 Peacham Crescent.

If you require information about potential future plans, I recommend checking for updates from the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) or subsequent environmental assessments that may address long-term management strategies for the area.

For further details or specific inquiries, please refer to the document itself.
