The shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" have specific impacts on local wildlife, particularly the aquatic species mentioned in the baseline inventory section. Here are some key points:

1. **Aquatic Species Monitoring**: The project includes a baseline inventory of aquatic species, with monitoring stations identifying the common species in the area, such as Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt (Document 1, page 14). This monitoring is essential to assess the health and abundance of these species prior to and during project implementation.

2. **Habitat Alteration**: The proposed structure and work associated with the shoreline maintenance may result in alteration or loss of aquatic habitats. The potential impact on fish habitats is evaluated to understand how construction might affect these species. These evaluations are crucial for planning mitigative measures (Document 3, page 22).

3. **Mitigation Measures**: To minimize the impact on aquatic ecosystems, the project adopts a careful design that aims to reduce disturbances to native materials, which could potentially be contaminated or have existing ecological value. The design considerations include maintaining the native habitat during construction to lessen adverse effects on local wildlife (Document 3, page 22; Document 13, page 25).

4. **Erosion and Sediment Control**: Erosion and sediment control measures are critical before construction begins. The project's procedures will prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse, thereby protecting aquatic wildlife during the projectâ€™s execution (Document 16, page 33).

5. **Restoration Plantings**: After the completion of construction phases, restoration plantings will occur, which may help in re-establishing the native habitat and promoting the recovery of local aquatic species (Document 20, page 36).

In summary, while the shoreline maintenance projects may temporarily disrupt local aquatic wildlife, careful planning, monitoring, and restorative actions are implemented to mitigate potential negative impacts on the ecosystem. The project emphasizes the importance of maintaining healthy aquatic habitats for species identified in the baseline inventory, which is crucial for the overall ecological integrity of the Humber Bay Park area.
