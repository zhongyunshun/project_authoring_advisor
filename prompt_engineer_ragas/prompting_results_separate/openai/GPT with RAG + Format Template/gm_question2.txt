The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several measures to ensure the protection and minimal disruption of local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory. Key actions include:

1. **Baseline Inventory Assessment**: A baseline inventory has been conducted, which includes detailed data collection on local aquatic species such as Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt. This inventory is critical for monitoring and understanding the local ecosystem (Source: Document 1 and Document 3).

2. **Monitoring Stations**: Three monitoring stations have been established to track aquatic species populations and habitat conditions. This ongoing monitoring helps in assessing the health of the aquatic ecosystem and guides conservation efforts (Source: Document 3).

3. **Design Considerations**: The project design aims to minimize disturbance to native materials in the shoreline area, which could potentially impact local habitats. Structures have been engineered to reduce cutting and disturbing the native material, thereby preserving the existing aquatic habitat (Source: Document 2).

4. **Erosion and Sediment Control**: Specific measures like the installation of silt socks and other erosion and sediment control mechanisms will be implemented prior to construction. This is intended to prevent the entry of harmful substances into watercourses, which can adversely affect aquatic life (Source: Document 8 and Document 9).

5. **Habitat Features Development**: Discussions are ongoing regarding enhancing aquatic habitat features, such as the introduction of a surcharged revetment to support biodiversity. This collaborative approach involves multiple stakeholders including TRCA and DFO (Source: Document 7).

6. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: After construction, there are plans for monitoring the site to ensure that the implemented measures remain effective and that local wildlife is supported in the post-project phase (Source: Document 22).

Collectively, these measures reflect a commitment to conservation and responsible stewardship of the local aquatic ecosystem during the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project.
