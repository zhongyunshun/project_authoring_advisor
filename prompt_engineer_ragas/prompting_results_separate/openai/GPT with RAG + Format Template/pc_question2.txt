The Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project indicates that there are measures proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife during the construction phase. Specifically, the plan includes:

1. **Minimizing Construction Footprint**: To reduce disturbances to existing natural habitats, all construction activities will be designed to occupy the smallest footprint feasible (Document 3, page 26).

2. **Timing of Activities**: Construction activities are planned to occur outside of key migration and breeding windows, which helps to minimize habitat disruptions when wildlife is most vulnerable (Document 3, page 26; Document 18, page 27). 

3. **Selective Tree Removal**: The project will involve minimal and highly selective tree removal aimed at ensuring there is no overall impact on the local vegetation communities, which are crucial for wildlife habitat (Document 13, page 26).

4. **Public Consultation and Notifications**: Engaging with community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities ensures that any concerns regarding wildlife and habitat can be addressed, maintaining transparency about the project’s impact (Document 17, page 48).

5. **Restoration Plan**: A comprehensive restoration plan is also part of the project framework, aimed at enhancing and rehabilitating disrupted habitats post-construction (Document 3, page 26).

Overall, the approach emphasizes ecological protection while still moving forward with essential erosion control measures. The selected strategies are in line with TRCA’s environmental stewardship goals.
