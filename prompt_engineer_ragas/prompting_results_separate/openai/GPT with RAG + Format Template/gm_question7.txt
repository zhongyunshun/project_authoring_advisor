The decision-making process for selecting erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches, involves careful consideration of their effectiveness, environmental impact, and site-specific conditions.

1. **Effectiveness**: The primary goal of these structures is to mitigate erosion along the shoreline. Armourstone headlands, for example, are designed to stabilize shorelines by providing a robust barrier against wave action. The selected sizes of armour stones (generally ranging from 2 to 4 tonnes, with some larger stones) are intended to ensure the stability and resilience of the structure against strong wave conditions (Documents 4 and 22).

2. **Environmental Impact**: The potential environmental effects of different materials and designs are weighed heavily in the planning process. Smaller cobble sizes might create a more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly beach environment, but they often require more material, which increases costs and the in-water footprint (Document 3). Conversely, armourstone, while robust, may not be as visually appealing but tends to offer superior long-term erosion protection. The design decisions also consider factors like habitat preservation, as indicated in references to maintaining good-quality fish habitats in transitional areas (Document 20).

3. **Site-Specific Conditions**: The decision-making is also guided by the specific conditions of the site, including existing erosion patterns, wave dynamics, and the geological characteristics of the shoreline. For instance, the use of the Hudson equation for selecting stone sizes is based on analyzing local coastal conditions (Documents 6 and 14). Additionally, minimizing cutting into banks to prevent exposure to potentially contaminated material is part of the design considerations during planning (Documents 6 and 22).

4. **Consultation and Collaboration**: The process is often collaborative, involving input from various stakeholders, including environmental authorities and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), to ensure comprehensive assessments and minimize ecological disruption during construction (Document 22).

Overall, the effective integration of these factors informs the choice between different types of erosion control structures to optimize flood defense, social usability, and long-term sustainability of the shoreline.
