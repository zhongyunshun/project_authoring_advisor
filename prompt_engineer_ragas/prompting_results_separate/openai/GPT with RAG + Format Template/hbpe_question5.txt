The "Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project" involves multiple phases, as noted in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II." The project comprises three distinct phases aimed at addressing shoreline maintenance and restoration over several years.

### Future Phases Planned:
1. **Phase I** - Focused on preliminary maintenance efforts, including site setup, tree removal, and construction of temporary structures.
2. **Phase II (Current Phase)** - Concentrates on the Western Headland and includes significant site restoration measures. Final site restoration is planned following the completion of all three phases. Some preliminary restoration activities will occur on the Eastern Headland after certain tasks are completed.
3. **Phase III** - Intended to involve additional construction efforts which may include the placement of beach materials and continued enhancements to the shoreline.

The documents highlight that each phase plays a critical role in the long-term maintenance and ecological restoration of the park's shoreline, ensuring stability and enhancing recreational use for the community (source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase II, pages 4, 35).
