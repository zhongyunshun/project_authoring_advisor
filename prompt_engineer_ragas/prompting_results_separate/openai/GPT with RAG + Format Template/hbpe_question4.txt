The roles and responsibilities of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and the City of Toronto in the maintenance and administration of Humber Bay Park East are articulated in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I." Specifically, TRCA is responsible for the strategic planning and implementation of maintenance projects within the park, focusing on erosion risk management and shoreline protection. This includes overseeing engineering services, habitat assessments, and project execution through coordination with engineering firms like Shoreplan Engineering Limited.

The City of Toronto, on the other hand, collaborates with TRCA in maintaining the public park aspects, which include managing park usage, ensuring user safety, and maintaining facilities such as trails and the beach. The integration of various stakeholders, including TRCA, the City of Toronto, and other relevant organizations, ensures a comprehensive approach to preserving both the ecological integrity of the park and the recreational opportunities it provides to the public (Source: HBPE Project Brief - Phase I, pages 3-6).
