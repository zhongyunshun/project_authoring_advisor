The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity with specific emphasis on bat species and butternut trees identified within the project area as follows:

1. **Bat Species**: The brief recognizes the presence of bat habitat within the project area and states that appropriate compensation measures will be coordinated by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority’s (TRCA) Environmental Resource Management (ERM) Project staff. This will occur in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol, which ensures that construction practices take the potential impacts on local bat populations into account (Document 8, page 10).

2. **Butternut Trees**: The brief acknowledges the identification of a Category 2 butternut tree within the project area that is positioned along the proposed access route. It notes that this particular tree, while affected by butternut canker, is not at an advanced degree of infection. Butternut trees are classified as endangered under Ontario’s Endangered Species Act, and therefore, the project brief emphasizes the importance of considering their health and the need for protective measures during construction activities (Document 1, page 11; Document 2, page 27).

Additionally, the project aims to minimize overall impacts through selective tree removals and post-construction restoration efforts that prioritize the replanting of suitable native species. This approach aims to enhance the overall biodiversity of the area, thus addressing potential negative effects that construction may have on the local ecosystem and specifically on the flora and fauna of concern identified in the ecology surveys (Document 21, page 27).

In summary, both bat species and butternut trees are given careful consideration within the project brief, illustrating TRCA's commitment to biodiversity conservation amidst developmental activities.
