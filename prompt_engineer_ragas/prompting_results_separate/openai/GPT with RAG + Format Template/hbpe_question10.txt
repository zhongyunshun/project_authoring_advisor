To address your query regarding how the restoration plantings described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" contribute to or mitigate against biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk, we can look to several key points highlighted within the documents.

1. **Commitment to Planting Native Species**: The preliminary planting plans for Phases I and II emphasize the on-site planting of 280 trees. These trees will be strategically located to enhance the local ecosystem's ability to support various species, including those at risk. By focusing on native species, the project aims to restore habitat that is more conducive to local wildlife, thereby countering the effects of previous disturbances (Document 3).

2. **Compensation for Tree Removals**: The document notes the anticipated removal of trees to facilitate construction, with subsequent plantings planned to compensate for these losses. This approach is designed to maintain or improve overall biodiversity. Specifically, the restoration plantings aim to enhance the ecological representation of native species once established, which is crucial for supporting at-risk species in the area (Document 5).

3. **Ecological Gains from Restoration**: The restoration efforts are positioned to create ecological benefits, including improved native species representation and increased habitat suitability. In doing so, the project aligns with requirements and guidelines to mitigate against biodiversity loss, particularly for species that are considered a concern (Document 4 and Document 19).

4. **Focus on Habitat Improvements**: The restoration plan is framed as an opportunity for habitat improvements, incorporating natural design principles that facilitate ecological benefits to the area. This includes the removal of exotic species and the establishment of native plantings, which collectively contribute to the enhancement of habitats necessary for species survival (Document 9 and Document 21).

In summary, the restoration plantings outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" not only aim to compensate for vegetation loss but also serve as a proactive measure to support local biodiversity, particularly for species at risk, by enhancing the natural habitat through native species introduction and ecological restoration strategies.
