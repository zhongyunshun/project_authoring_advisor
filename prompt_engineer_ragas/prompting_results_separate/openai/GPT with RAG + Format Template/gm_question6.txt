To address potential social impacts, such as access to parklands and community recreational spaces, the erosion hazard management efforts in areas like German Mills Settlers Park include several considerations and strategies. The German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project aims to mitigate risks associated with erosion along German Mills Creek, particularly because this erosion poses safety hazards to park users and could impact public access to recreational areas.

1. **Safety and Access Management**: The project acknowledges the potential risks to trail infrastructure and public safety (Document 1). Proposed solutions might include safety features like fencing, which could help maintain access while protecting users from hazards (Document 7).

2. **Public Consultation and Community Input**: The project brief emphasizes the importance of community feedback regarding the enhancement of the park's terrestrial and aquatic habitat, as well as the preservation of public enjoyment of natural spaces (Document 3). Engaging community members can provide insights into how infrastructure protection works can be designed with minimal disruption to recreational activities.

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: The implementation of erosion and sediment control measures is a critical aspect of the project. Standard practices will be utilized to protect watercourses and minimize disturbances during construction, which can help maintain access to various park sections (Document 6).

4. **Long-Term Infrastructure Solutions**: The project aims to provide a long-term solution for regional sanitary infrastructure and the cityâ€™s stormwater systems, thereby contributing to the overall health and usability of the park over time (Document 18). This ensures that recreation and access to parklands can continue, even as protective measures are implemented.

5. **Habitat Restoration Opportunities**: The project also recognizes the opportunity to improve aquatic and terrestrial habitats through post-implementation site restoration, which can enhance the overall recreational quality of the park (Document 18).

Overall, the erosion hazard management plans are designed not only to protect infrastructure but also to ensure that community access and recreational opportunities in German Mills Settlers Park are preserved and enhanced.
