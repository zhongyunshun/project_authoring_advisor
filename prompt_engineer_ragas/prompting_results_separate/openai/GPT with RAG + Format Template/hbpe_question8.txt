The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the newly installed erosion control measures, as outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I," include the following key points:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will undergo inspections during the first year after major storm events and annually thereafter. This is to ensure that the installed erosion control measures remain stable and perform as intended. Any necessary maintenance will be conducted as identified during these inspections (Source: Document 1, Page 36).

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Maintenance**: The plans include the implementation of ESC measures prior to, during, and after construction. Any damaged or ineffective erosion and sediment control measures must be repaired or replaced within 48 hours post-inspection to minimize disturbance to the environment and potential ecological impacts (Source: Document 5, Page 4; Document 15, Page 45).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring by trained professionals will ensure that best management practices are adhered to throughout the construction and post-construction phases. Adjustments to erosion and sediment control strategies may be necessary as site conditions change (Source: Document 6, Page 4).

4. **Restoration and Re-vegetation**: Following the initial construction phase, there will be an emphasis on site restoration through regrading and seeding, with further restoration activities occurring after complete project implementation. Effective erosion control measures will be maintained until the site is fully re-vegetated (Source: Document 9, Page 34; Document 13, Page 34).

These strategies are vital for ensuring the long-term efficacy of the erosion control measures and the sustainability of the parkâ€™s environment.
