The "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" document does not explicitly outline the detailed roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the Class Environmental Assessment (EA) process for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project. However, it emphasizes the involvement of various parties in the public consultation and decision-making process.

For instance, Document 3 mentions that public notifications and consultations began with the publication of a Notice of Intent, indicating that the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) took the lead in engaging community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities regarding the project (Page 48). 

Additionally, Document 12 provides acknowledgments to various contributors from the TRCA, highlighting the collaborative efforts within the organization itself, although it does not provide in-depth descriptions of individual roles (Page 2). 

Overall, while the term "stakeholders" may broadly encompass local residents, municipal authorities, Indigenous communities, and environmental groups, specific roles and responsibilities may require further details beyond what is succinctly captured in the excerpts provided. For a comprehensive understanding, one might need to refer to the full project plan or consult directly with the TRCA for detailed stakeholder engagement frameworks.
