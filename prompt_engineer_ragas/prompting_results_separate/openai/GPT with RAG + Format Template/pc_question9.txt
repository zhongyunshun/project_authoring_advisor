The engagement of Indigenous communities in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project involved several key actions and outcomes. 

1. **Consultation Process**: A full record of Indigenous community consultation, including copies of all correspondence, is documented in the Record of Indigenous Engagement for the project (Document 1). This indicates there was a structured approach to involve these communities.

2. **Timely Notifications**: The first public contact associated with the project was the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018. Notifications were sent not only to community groups and homeowners nearby but also specifically to Indigenous communities, indicating an inclusive outreach strategy (Document 2).

3. **List of Engaged Indigenous Groups**: Several Indigenous communities were identified as stakeholders, including the Beausoleil First Nation, Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, Chippewas of Rama-Mnjikaning First Nation, Huron-Wendat Nation, and others (Document 3). This shows a comprehensive approach in recognizing and reaching out to diverse Indigenous stakeholders.

4. **Addressing Concerns**: As captured in the reports, there were no major concerns raised by the Indigenous communities specifically regarding this project, which suggests that the engagement process was effective in addressing any potential issues or uncertainties (Document 1).

5. **Community Feedback Mechanism**: Feedback mechanisms were established, as highlighted by the distribution of comment forms following a community consultation meeting. This facilitated communication and ensured that stakeholders had a platform to express their views and inquiries (Document 19).

Collectively, these components reflect a commitment by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) to engage Indigenous communities throughout the planning stages of the project, fostering an inclusive environment that aimed to respect and integrate Indigenous perspectives in decision-making. The absence of significant concerns raised indicates a positive outcome from the engagement efforts.
