The slope stabilization project on Peacham Crescent will address potential social impacts and ensure the safety of the local community through several strategies. According to the Class EA Project Plan, the project involves public consultation and notifications to keep local residents informed about the project and its implications. The first point of public contact was marked by the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018, and notices were sent to community groups, homeowners in the vicinity, and Indigenous communities to ensure stakeholder engagement.

In terms of community safety, the plan assesses public safety risks associated with the construction work, particularly along trails and slopes, rating the potential impacts as low to moderate. Safety features, such as safety fences, will be implemented to mitigate risks to the public during construction. Furthermore, the proposed design aims to maintain existing pedestrian pathways but may require temporary restrictions during construction to ensure the safety of pedestrians.

Overall, the project emphasizes risk mitigation and community engagement as critical components of its strategy to minimize social impacts and enhance local safety.
