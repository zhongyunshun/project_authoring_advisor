The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects like the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" include:

1. **Post Construction Monitoring**: The site will be inspected during the first year following major storm events and annually thereafter to ensure that the implemented works are stable and performing as designed. Any maintenance that is found to be required will be addressed promptly.

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures**: Prior to and during construction, erosion and sediment control measures will be implemented and maintained to prevent sediment from entering the water. All damaged measures must be repaired or replaced within 48 hours of inspection.

3. **Pre- and Post-Construction Monitoring**: There will be monitoring of erosion as well as photographic records, especially regarding vegetation survivability for two years after planting.

4. **Regular Inspections by Trained Professionals**: During construction, trained professionals will regularly monitor the site to ensure that best management practices are being followed and to address any disturbances to the environment immediately.

5. **Adjustments as Needed**: The erosion and sediment control strategies outlined in the plans are flexible and may need amendments based on changing site conditions to minimize runoff of sediment and other deleterious substances.

6. **Long-Term Monitoring**: Long-term monitoring, including documented inspections at specified intervals, will be maintained to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the erosion control measures and the restoration of natural features.

These strategies help to ensure that the erosion control measures remain functional and that the natural ecosystem is preserved over time.
