The selection of erosion control structures for the Humber Bay Park East Project, such as armourstone headlands and gravel beaches, was based on several criteria, including their effectiveness in mitigating erosion and their environmental impacts. 

1. **Erosion Control Effectiveness**: The structures were designed to address specific erosion concerns inherent to each site condition. For instance, the eastern armourstone headland (WF11.12) was selected due to its ability to withstand wave overtopping and stabilize the shoreline with minimal excavation (Document 5). Similarly, the cobble/gravel beach (WF11.11) was considered because smaller cobble sizes can make for a user-friendly beach environment, although they require more material for effective shoreline protection (Document 11).

2. **Assessment of Existing Conditions**: The condition of existing structures was systematically assessed, as reflected in Table 1 of the concept brief, which provided a summary of the stability and deficiencies of each structure. This assessment informed decisions on whether to repair or replace existing structures or create new ones (Document 3).

3. **Environmental Impact Considerations**: The documents indicate an emphasis on minimizing disturbance to native materials to reduce ecological degradation (Document 19). The chosen materials and construction strategies aim to mitigate impacts on aquatic habitats while ensuring that the sites can effectively cope with flooding and erosion without introducing significant environmental harm.

4. **Interim Measures**: In some cases, interim solutions like adding stone to scours were employed to enhance shoreline protection temporarily while longer-term solutions were developed, demonstrating a careful consideration for immediate effectiveness (Document 6).

Ultimately, the approach involved a comprehensive evaluation of structural performance, environmental sensitivities, and the need for user-friendly recreational spaces, which collectively informed the decision-making process for the chosen erosion control measures at Humber Bay Park East.
