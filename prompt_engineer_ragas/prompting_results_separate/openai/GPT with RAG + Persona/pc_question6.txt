The anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project include potential effects on local wildlife habitats, vegetation communities, and societal factors related to the surrounding neighborhood. According to the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP," the project is designed to address these impacts in the following ways:

1. **Environmental Impacts**:
   - **Wildlife and Vegetation**: The project anticipates minimal impact on significant wildlife populations, as there are none identified within the Project limits. Existing vegetation communities will be preserved as much as possible. Construction activities will be planned with the intention of maintaining a small construction footprint, and scheduling them outside key migration and breeding seasons to minimize habitat disruption (Document 18, page 26).
   - **Soil and Erosion**: The project aims to protect against valley slope erosion that threatens private properties, indicating a direct relationship between erosion control and the preservation of ecological balance within the area (Document 3, page 7). 

2. **Social Impacts**:
   - **Community Engagement**: The project has engaged in public notifications and consultations. The first point of public contact was through a published Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018, which helped to inform local residents and communities about the project and its scope (Document 4, page 48).
   - **Public Safety**: The project proposes to install safety features, such as fences, along trails and slopes to mitigate risks and support public safety, addressing the community's concerns (Document 11, page 42). 

3. **Mitigation Measures**: 
   - The project includes a comprehensive restoration plan aimed at minimizing adverse impacts and promoting environmental recovery after construction (Document 18, page 26).
   - The engineering design also considers long-term, low maintenance solutions that protect properties and lives from erosion, aligning with the objectives set forth by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (Document 5, page 3).

Overall, the implementation of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, detailed in the Class EA Project Plan, aims to balance environmental conservation with community safety and engagement, ensuring that both ecological and social impacts are carefully managed.
