The shoreline maintenance projects outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" are designed with considerations for local wildlife, particularly aquatic species. The baseline inventory section indicates that several aquatic species are monitored in the area, such as Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt.

The project specifics include:

1. **Aquatic Habitat Components**: The design incorporates features aimed at enhancing aquatic habitats, including the installation of surcharged revetments. This design is intended to support local aquatic life by providing additional structural elements that can promote habitat diversity.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**: Although there is no in-water work associated with the project, TRCA is mindful of the potential impacts on the aquatic environment. Regular surveys and assessments will be conducted to evaluate fish habitats and the overall health of aquatic ecosystems as the project progresses (as noted in Documents 8 and 9).

3. **Mitigation Measures**: The project includes various environmental safeguards to minimize disruption to existing habitats. For example, measures to prevent contamination and the use of sediment control techniques are planned to mitigate any adverse effects on water quality and aquatic populations (Document 16).

4. **Baseline Surveys**: The baseline inventory conducted in preparation for the project helps identify existing species and their habitats, allowing for informed decisions regarding site interventions. This ongoing assessment ensures that impacts on species such as native fish and their spawning habitats are monitored and managed throughout the project phases (Document 11).

Overall, while the shoreline maintenance projects may alter habitats, TRCA is implementing strategies to minimize negative impacts and enhance aquatic habitats, thereby supporting the local wildlife.
