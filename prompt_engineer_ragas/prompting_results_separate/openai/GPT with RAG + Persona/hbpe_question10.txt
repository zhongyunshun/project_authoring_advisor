The restoration plantings described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" play a crucial role in mitigating biodiversity loss, specifically concerning species at risk. The preliminary planting plans focus on the on-site planting of 280 trees, which is intended to contribute to habitat restoration and enhance local biodiversity. By introducing suitable native species, these plantings help to rebuild the local habitat and create a more robust ecological environment.

Additionally, the project emphasizes the importance of selective tree and shrub removals, which are planned to minimize the impacts on species of concern. The commitment to replanting suitable native species not only compensates for those that were removed but also supports the overall goal of enhancing the biodiversity of the area. Furthermore, the project aligns with TRCA's guidelines, ensuring that the ecological gains from improving native species representation are recognized and fostered, thereby aiding in the protection and recovery of species at risk. 

In essence, these efforts aim to restore ecological functions, stabilize soil, reduce erosion, and enhance the resilience of the local ecosystem to future environmental changes, thereby addressing the challenges posed by biodiversity loss.
