The German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project involves multiple stakeholders, each with distinct roles and responsibilities to ensure the project's success:

1. **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA)**: TRCA plays a pivotal role in leading the project, focused on erosion risk management and environmental protection. They collaborate with local municipalities and engineering firms to assess risks, plan interventions, and oversee the implementation of the protection works along German Mills Creek.

2. **York Region Environmental Services**: As a partner with TRCA, York Region is responsible for environmental assessments and ensuring that the project aligns with regional standards and practices. They assist in identifying infrastructure needs and managing the impact on the local environment and community.

3. **Engineering Firms (e.g., Greck and Associates)**: Engineering firms are contracted to evaluate the technical aspects of the project, such as conducting assessments, designing infrastructure protection measures, and creating cost estimates. They also provide expertise in evaluating alternatives for construction and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations.

4. **Local Municipalities**: Municipalities, like the City of Markham, collaborate in planning and public communication processes. They facilitate community engagement, allowing local stakeholders to voice their concerns and provide feedback on the project.

5. **Indigenous Communities**: Engagement with Indigenous communities is crucial for incorporating traditional knowledge and perspectives into the project planning and execution. TRCA ensures that Indigenous interests are considered throughout the project life cycle.

6. **Public Stakeholders**: The general public and local interest groups also play an essential role by participating in public meetings and consultations. Their feedback helps shape the approach to infrastructure protection and preservation of park amenities.

These collective roles are essential to address the erosion issues in German Mills Creek while minimizing environmental impacts and enhancing community value.
