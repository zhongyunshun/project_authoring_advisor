The erosion control and slope stabilization efforts for both the Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent projects are planned in phases. 

For the **Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project**, it is explicitly stated that the project has been divided into three phases for design and implementation due to its extensive area and multi-year construction nature.

Regarding the **Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project**, while specific future phases are not detailed in the documents retrieved, the structured approach of the assessments and the mention of ongoing considerations suggest that future expansions or phases could be adapted based on the evaluation of the initial stages and the effectiveness of the implemented solutions.

Overall, both projects indicate a phased strategy, with the possibility of adjustments or expansions based on performance and findings during the initial execution phases.
