The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" outlines several long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies to ensure the durability and effectiveness of the implemented slope stabilization measures. These recommendations include:

1. **Regular Inspections**: Conduct periodic inspections of the stabilization measures to assess their condition and effectiveness.

2. **Maintenance of Vegetation**: Periodic maintenance of the vegetation in the area will be necessary during the initial years until the vegetation becomes well established.

3. **Follow-Up Assessments**: Additional assessments may be conducted to determine if the stabilization measures are performing as intended and to identify any required adjustments or repairs.

These strategies aim to maintain the integrity of the slope stabilization measures and minimize future erosion risks.
