The erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park takes into account potential social impacts by incorporating strategies to maintain access to parklands and community recreational spaces. According to the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project documentation, the project not only focuses on the technical issues of erosion control and infrastructure protection but also emphasizes enhancing the surrounding environment.

In particular, the project includes a secondary objective of improving aquatic and terrestrial habitats while preserving public enjoyment of the natural space. This approach aims to ensure that park users can continue to access recreational areas safely while addressing infrastructure vulnerabilities due to erosion. Measures such as safety features (e.g., safety fences) are considered to protect users, thereby mitigating potential risks to public safety.

Moreover, the implementation of erosion and sediment control measures during construction aims to minimize disturbances and maintain the integrity of park access for the community. The goal is to provide long-term protection for both infrastructure and recreational spaces, ensuring that social impacts are minimized and that community access remains a priority throughout the project. This structured approach aligns with the principles of sustainable management of natural resources and public spaces.
