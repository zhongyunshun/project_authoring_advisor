The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity through careful planning and mitigation measures, particularly concerning bat species and butternut trees in the area. 

1. **Bat Species**: The document notes that bat habitat is present within the project area, and appropriate compensation measures will be coordinated by TRCA’s Environmental Resources Management Project staff in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol. This suggests a commitment to monitoring and protecting bat populations during construction activities (Document 8).

2. **Butternut Trees**: The project has identified a Category 2 butternut tree that is located along the proposed access route. This tree is neither severely affected by Butternut Canker nor significantly compromised. It is important to note that butternut trees are considered an endangered species under Ontario’s Endangered Species Act. The document highlights that the butternut identified within the construction access route has been shown to be genetically pure, which makes it particularly vulnerable to butternut canker, emphasizing the need for careful management of this species in the project activities (Documents 1 and 2).

3. **Construction Planning**: To minimize impacts, all construction activities are scheduled to occur outside key migration and breeding windows while also employing a highly selective removal strategy for any necessary tree or shrub removals. This is intended to lessen the overall impact on both wildlife and vegetation communities and promote post-construction restoration efforts aimed at enhancing biodiversity (Documents 20 and 21).

Overall, the project brief outlines specific measures to mitigate potential risks to biodiversity, particularly focusing on the preservation of bat species and the categorically protected butternut trees during the construction process.
