The project planning and implementation phases involve specific engagements and consultations with local Indigenous communities as detailed in several documents. Here are the key points:

1. **Indigenous Engagement Process**: The TRCA engages with Indigenous communities to provide them with information and gather input on project proposals. This engagement takes different forms based on community interests and project scope. The emphasis is placed on developing positive relationships through meaningful and respectful engagement.

2. **Consultation Records**: A full record of Indigenous community consultation is maintained, including correspondence related to the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project. This includes notifications sent to Indigenous communities and responses received during the consultation phases.

3. **Specific Communities Consulted**: Notable Indigenous communities such as the Credit First Nation, Williams Treaties First Nations, and the Huron-Wendat Nation were identified for consultation. The projects ensured that there are no adverse effects on traditional land uses based on engagements with these communities.

4. **Ministry Involvement**: Before consultations, ministries such as the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) and the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation (MIRR) were contacted for guidance on which communities should be engaged. Community contact lists were utilized to ensure comprehensive outreach.

5. **Details on Notifications**: Notifications regarding project progress, such as the Notice of Intent and Notice of Filing, were couriered and emailed to Indigenous communities, and meetings were held for feedback and discussions.

6. **Engagement Guidelines**: The TRCA’s Indigenous Engagement is guided by specific engagement guidelines that were followed throughout various projects, ensuring Indigenous interests were acknowledged and respected.

This structured approach ensures that Indigenous communities are actively involved throughout planning and implementation, aligning with their rights and contributing to the projects’ success.
