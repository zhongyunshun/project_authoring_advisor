The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project is implementing several measures to ensure the protection and minimal disruption of local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory. Key initiatives include:

1. **Aquatic Habitat Considerations**: The design of protection structures is intended to minimize the cutting and disturbing of native materials, which is critical for maintaining the existing aquatic habitats (Document 2).

2. **Erosion and Sediment Control**: Before construction begins, standard erosion and sediment control measures such as silt socks will be put in place around staging and stockpiling areas. This is designed to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse, thereby safeguarding aquatic life (Documents 8 and 9).

3. **Baseline Inventory Data Utilization**: Baseline conditions, including fish populations and habitats, have been thoroughly documented. This data guides the development of aquatic habitat features and ensures that construction impacts are well understood and managed (Documents 3 and 21).

4. **Monitoring Stations**: There are three monitoring stations established at key points in the park to track fish populations and health, providing ongoing data to support wildlife protection efforts (Documents 3 and 21).

5. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: Inspections of the site will occur during the first year after completion of major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter. This long-term monitoring will ensure that the measures taken to protect wildlife and aquatic habitats are effective and functioning as intended (Document 22).

These measures aim to protect the diverse aquatic species present in the park while allowing for necessary maintenance and upgrades to the shoreline.
