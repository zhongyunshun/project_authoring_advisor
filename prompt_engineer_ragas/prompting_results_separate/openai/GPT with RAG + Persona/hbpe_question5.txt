The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is divided into three phases for design and implementation. The future phases mentioned in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" include:

1. **Phase I** - This phase has already been completed and involved essential maintenance work and improvements to the eastern headland.
   
2. **Phase II** - Currently ongoing, this phase focuses on the Western Headland, with activities aimed at mitigating erosion and restoring ecological integrity along the shoreline.

3. **Phase III** - This phase is planned for future execution, which will include additional restoration works and beach material placement to further protect and enhance the shoreline.

The intent of these phases is to ensure the long-term health and accessibility of the park's habitats while addressing erosion risks.
