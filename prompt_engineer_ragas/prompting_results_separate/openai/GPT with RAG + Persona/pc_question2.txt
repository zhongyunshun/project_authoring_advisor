The Ecology Survey for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project indicates that while there are no significant wildlife populations within the project limits and minimal impacts to bird habitat are anticipated, specific mitigation measures are being employed to reduce potential disturbances. The following measures are proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife:

1. **Minimized Construction Footprint**: Construction activities are planned to have the smallest construction footprint possible to limit disruption to habitats.

2. **Timing of Activities**: Construction will occur outside of key migration and breeding windows when habitat use is less critical. This scheduling helps in avoiding potential disturbances to nesting birds and other wildlife during their important life stages.

3. **Selective Vegetation Management**: Any removal of canopy trees will be highly selective and kept to a minimum, which aims to preserve the overall health of vegetation communities within the area, including those that provide habitat for wildlife.

4. **Erosion and Sediment Control**: Implementation of erosion and sediment control measures, such as sediment control fencing, will be in place prior to construction to prevent deleterious substances from entering nearby watercourses, thus protecting aquatic habitats that may support local wildlife.

These measures are part of a comprehensive strategy to ensure that potential negative impacts on local wildlife during the stabilization project are minimized effectively.
