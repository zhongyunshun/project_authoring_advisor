The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation. These practices include:

1. **Erosion Control Measures**: The project addresses significant erosion concerns by placing new materials over existing structures to improve toe and slope stability while minimizing excavation. This method reduces disturbance to the natural environment and preserves native materials as much as possible.

2. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: Following construction, the site will undergo inspections during the first year after major storm events and annual evaluations to ensure stability and performance of the implemented works. This ongoing monitoring allows for maintenance and adjustments that support environmental health.

3. **Restoration Plantings**: The site restoration plan includes regrading and seeding, aiming to restore vegetation that will enhance habitat quality and stabilize soil, contributing to ecosystem resilience.

4. **Design Considerations for Climate Change**: The project integrates considerations for climate change impacts, such as potential alterations in water levels and increased storm severity, into its design. This foresight helps to create structures that are more resilient to future environmental changes.

5. **Minimizing Disturbance**: The design approach aims to reduce cutting and disturbance of native materials, which helps maintain the existing ecosystem and minimizes the introduction of invasive species.

These sustainable practices collectively aim to protect and enhance the natural environment while ensuring the safety and enjoyment of park users.
