The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects like the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project include:

1. **Site Inspections**: The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and then on an annual basis. This is to ensure that the implemented erosion control works are stable and performing as designed.

2. **Maintenance Requirements**: Any maintenance required will be identified during these inspections to ensure the longevity and effectiveness of the erosion control measures.

3. **Post Construction Monitoring**: This involves ongoing assessment of the project's performance in terms of its stability and structural integrity over time.

These strategies help in mitigating erosion risks and ensuring the stability of the shoreline infrastructure.
