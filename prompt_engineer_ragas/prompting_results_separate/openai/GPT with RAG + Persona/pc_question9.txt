The Indigenous communities were engaged in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project through a structured consultation process outlined in the Record of Indigenous Engagement. This document includes all correspondence and the details of community consultations. 

According to the materials, the initial public contact occurred with the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018, which involved notifications sent to various stakeholders, including Indigenous communities. The specific Indigenous groups consulted included the Beausoleil First Nation, Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, Chippewas of Rama-Mnjikaning First Nation, Huron-Wendat Nation, and several others associated with the Williams Treaties.

Outcomes from this engagement indicated that there were no major concerns raised about the project by Indigenous communities. However, it is emphasized that a comprehensive record of their engagement reflects an effort to include these communities in the discussion around the project, ensuring their voices were heard in the planning stages. 

Overall, the engagement process aimed at fostering understanding and addressing any concerns that may arise, although significant concerns did not manifest.
