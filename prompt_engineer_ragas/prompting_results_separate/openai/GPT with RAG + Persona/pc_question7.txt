Based on the "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final," the key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives included:

1. **Factors of Safety**: The alternatives were developed with a focus on a Factor of Safety (FOS) of 1.3, which was a requirement specified by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA).

2. **Soil Composition**: The existing soil conditions behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent, which were primarily identified as very loose to compact/soft to stiff earth fill materials, influenced the feasibility and design of the stabilization options.

3. **Comparison of Alternatives**: Five potential stabilization alternatives were assessed based on feasibility, constructability, and cost. This comparative analysis allowed for a systematic evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

4. **Risk Mitigation**: The need for effective stabilization solutions to address slope failure and erosion risks played a significant role in the decision-making process.

5. **Environmental Considerations**: Selected alternatives needed to mitigate impacts on existing vegetation and also address issues related to drainage and stormwater runoff.

6. **Public Safety**: Ensuring public safety along the trail and slope was a critical consideration in selecting the stabilization methods.

7. **Stakeholder Feedback**: The input received during the stakeholder and public review process was also taken into account before finalizing the preferred alternative.

These factors collectively guided the selection of the preferred alternative, which ultimately was identified as the Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) Structure.
