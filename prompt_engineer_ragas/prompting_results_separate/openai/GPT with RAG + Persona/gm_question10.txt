The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project includes a strategy for tree removals and restoration plantings aimed at mitigating biodiversity loss, particularly concerning species at risk like bats and butternut trees.

1. **Tree Removals**: The project plans to remove a significant number of trees—identified as 180—primarily to facilitate construction access and slope stabilization. However, these removals are designed to be minimal and highly selective, with an emphasis on mitigating impacts to existing vegetation and wildlife habitat. Specific measures include conducting removals outside bird nesting seasons to avoid impacting breeding activities (as mandated by the Migratory Birds Convention Act).

2. **Restoration Plantings**: After the stabilization works are carried out, the project includes comprehensive post-construction restoration activities. These will focus on replanting suitable native species which are expected to enhance biodiversity in the area once established. The restoration efforts aim to improve soil stabilization and habitat conditions, thus eventually supporting the recovery of flora and fauna, including species at risk.

3. **Protection of Species at Risk**: The butternut tree, classified as an endangered species under Ontario’s Endangered Species Act, is specifically mentioned in relation to the project. The genetic tests revealing the presence of genetically pure butternut trees in the area have led to proactive protection measures. Efforts to retain these trees, even amidst removals, underscore the commitment to safeguarding not just the butternut trees but also the associated ecosystem.

4. **Biodiversity Goals**: Overall, the project's design includes a restoration plan that aims to increase biodiversity, particularly by establishing native plant communities that can provide habitat and support for various species, including bats. Given that tree canopies are essential for bat habitat, careful planning related to canopy management will assist in sustaining the local bat populations.

In summary, while the project entails some tree removals, it strategically balances these actions with restoration efforts that aim to protect and enhance biodiversity, particularly for sensitive species like bats and butternuts, thereby addressing potential biodiversity losses effectively.
