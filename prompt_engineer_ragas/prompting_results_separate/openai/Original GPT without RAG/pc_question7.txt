I’m sorry, but I don’t have access to specific documents, including "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final." However, I can help guide you on what typical key factors might be considered when selecting preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives, such as:

1. **Site Conditions**: Assessment of geological, hydrological, and environmental conditions that may impact slope stability.

2. **Cost**: Detailed analysis of the total cost of implementation, including initial construction and long-term maintenance.

3. **Efficacy**: Evaluation of how effective the alternative is in stabilizing the slope based on existing literature or case studies.

4. **Environmental Impact**: Consideration of the potential impacts on local ecosystems, including flora and fauna, as well as water quality.

5. **Community and Stakeholder Input**: Engagement with local stakeholders and communities to gather input and concerns regarding proposed alternatives.

6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring adherence to local, state, and federal regulations regarding construction and environmental protection.

7. **Technical Feasibility**: Assessment of the engineering challenges and technical approaches necessary to implement the stabilization.

8. **Sustainability**: Evaluation of the long-term sustainability of the chosen solution and its ability to withstand future environmental changes.

If you have access to the report and can share specific passages or details, I could provide more tailored insights.
