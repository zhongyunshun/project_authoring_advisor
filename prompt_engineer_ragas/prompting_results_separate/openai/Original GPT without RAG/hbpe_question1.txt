I'm sorry, but I cannot access or retrieve specific documents such as the "Design Brief - Phase II." However, I can provide general information on the typical engineering challenges and considerations that are often addressed during the detailed design process for shoreline protection projects.

In shoreline protection projects like those at Humber Bay Park East, engineers typically consider the following challenges:

1. **Erosion Control**: Addressing the natural erosion processes that may impact the shoreline, ensuring the protection measures can withstand wave action and currents.

2. **Material Selection**: Choosing materials that are both durable and environmentally friendly, including the considerations of how these materials interact with local wildlife and ecosystems.

3. **Flood Risk Management**: Designing structures to mitigate the risk of flooding, particularly in areas susceptible to storm surges and high water levels.

4. **Hydrological Modeling**: Understanding the water flow dynamics and sediment transport along the shoreline to design effective interventions.

5. **Ecological Impact**: Assessing how construction and materials will affect local flora and fauna, including habitat preservation and enhancement strategies.

6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhering to local, regional, and national regulations regarding shoreline development, environmental protection, and land use.

7. **Community Engagement**: Involving local communities and stakeholders in the design process to address their concerns and ensure that the project meets their needs.

8. **Future Climate Change Resilience**: Considering the long-term impacts of climate change on sea level rise and extreme weather events in the design of protective measures.

If you have access to the specific document and can share elements or excerpts, I may be able to help you analyze those details further.
