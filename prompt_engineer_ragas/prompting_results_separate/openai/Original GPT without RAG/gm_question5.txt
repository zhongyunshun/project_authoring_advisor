As of my last update in October 2023, specific future phases or expansions for erosion control and slope stabilization efforts in Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent would typically be determined by local government plans, environmental assessments, and community needs. For the most accurate and current information regarding these projects, I recommend checking with the City of Toronto's Parks and Recreation or Environment and Conservation departments, as they often publish details on ongoing and future projects. Local council meetings or community newsletters may also provide updates on any expanded initiatives.
