I currently don't have access to specific documents or content that was produced after my last update in October 2023, including the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP." However, I can provide a general outline of typical roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in a Class Environmental Assessment (EA) process, which you may find relevant for your inquiry about the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project.

1. **Proponents**:
   - **Project Lead/Proponent**: Responsible for initiating the EA, preparing the documentation, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
   - **Consultants**: May be hired to conduct studies, prepare reports, and provide expert advice relevant to the EA.

2. **Regulatory Agencies**:
   - **Provincial or Federal Agencies**: Oversee the EA process to ensure it meets legal and environmental standards. They may review the assessments and provide feedback.
   - **Municipal Agencies**: Involved in local planning and may have a role in reviewing the EA to ensure alignment with local policies.

3. **Indigenous Communities**:
   - **Indigenous Stakeholders**: Engage with the project to assess impacts on Indigenous rights, lands, and communities, ensuring their concerns are incorporated into the EA process.

4. **Public Stakeholders**:
   - **Community Members**: Residents and local stakeholders who may provide input on the projectâ€™s potential impacts and express concerns during public consultation periods.
   - **Interest Groups**: Non-governmental organizations and advocacy groups focused on environmental, social, or economic impacts who may engage in the EA process.

5. **Technical Experts**:
   - **Environmental Scientists and Engineers**: Conduct surveys and assessments related to ecology, hydrology, and engineering aspects of the project.
   - **Public Health Experts**: May be involved to assess potential human health impacts related to the proposed project.

6. **Advisory Committees**:
   - **Steering Committees or Working Groups**: Composed of representatives from various stakeholder groups, providing advice and facilitating dialogue throughout the EA process.

The specifics of the roles and responsibilities for stakeholders in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project's Class EA would be detailed in the document you referenced. To get precise information, I recommend reviewing the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP," where stakeholder responsibilities are typically outlined in detail.
