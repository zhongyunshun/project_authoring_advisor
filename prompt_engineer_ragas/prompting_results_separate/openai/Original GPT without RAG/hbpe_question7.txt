In the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief," the selection of various erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and gravel beaches, was guided by a combination of factors focusing on their effectiveness in erosion management and their environmental impact. The effectiveness of each structure was assessed based on its ability to withstand wave action, reduce erosion, and maintain the park's aesthetic and ecological value.

Armourstone headlands were chosen for their durability and proven effectiveness in providing a strong barrier against wave forces, minimizing erosion along critical areas. Meanwhile, gravel beaches were considered for their ability to offer a more natural shoreline that supports local ecosystems while still providing some level of erosion protection. 

The decision-making process also took into account the potential environmental impacts of these structures, including the effects on local wildlife, water quality, and sediment transport. Structures were designed to harmonize with the natural landscape and promote biodiversity wherever possible, ensuring that human interventions did not detrimentally affect the existing ecological balance.

Overall, a comprehensive evaluation of both the engineering performance and ecological outcomes played a key role in selecting the most suitable erosion control measures for Humber Bay Park East.
