Unfortunately, I do not have access to specific documents or reports, including the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief." To address potential impacts on biodiversity, especially regarding bat species and butternut trees, one would typically look for sections of the project brief that discuss:

1. **Environmental Assessments**: Details on how flora and fauna, particularly sensitive species such as bats and butternut trees, are evaluated in terms of potential impacts from the project.

2. **Mitigation Strategies**: Measures proposed to minimize any adverse effects on these species, which could include habitat preservation, timing of construction to avoid sensitive periods (like mating or roosting seasons for bats), and specific protocols for protecting butternut trees.

3. **Monitoring Plans**: Plans for ongoing monitoring of biodiversity impacts during and after project implementation to ensure that any detrimental effects are addressed promptly.

4. **Engagement with Ecologists**: Consultation with wildlife and plant experts to inform project design and implementation.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to local, state, and federal regulations concerning protected species and habitats.

To get the specific details from the brief, you may need to refer directly to the document or consult with an environmental expert involved in the project.
