I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific documents, including the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief." However, I can provide general long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies commonly recommended for slope stabilization measures. These may include:

1. **Regular Inspections:** Conduct routine inspections to assess the condition of the stabilization measures, looking for signs of erosion, cracking, or settling.

2. **Monitoring of Vegetation:** Maintain plant cover to prevent erosion; monitor the health of vegetation for signs of stress or disease, which may affect slope stability.

3. **Drainage Management:** Ensure that drainage systems are functioning effectively to prevent water accumulation that could lead to slope failure.

4. **Erosion Control Practices:** Implement erosion control techniques, such as installing silt fences or mulch, to protect against surface runoff.

5. **Instrumentation:** Use inclinometers, piezometers, or other geotechnical instruments to monitor slope movements and groundwater levels over time.

6. **Repairs and Rehabilitation:** Plan for timely repairs to any damaged components of the stabilization system, such as retaining walls, vegetation cover, or drainage systems.

7. **Community Involvement:** Engage local communities in monitoring efforts and education about the importance of slope stability and proper land use practices.

8. **Documentation and Reporting:** Maintain detailed records of inspections, maintenance activities, and any changes in site conditions for future reference.

If you have access to the specific document, I recommend consulting it for tailored strategies that apply directly to that project.
