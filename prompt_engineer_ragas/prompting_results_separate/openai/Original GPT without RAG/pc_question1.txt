The "Long-Term Stable Slope Crests" (LTSSC) concept in the context of slope stability and erosion risk assessment typically refers to specific geomorphological features that are expected to remain stable over an extended period, minimizing the risk of erosion or landslides. 

In the Peacham Crescent projects, criteria to determine LTSSC may include:

1. **Geological Stability:** Assessment of the underlying geology, including soil composition, rock types, and stratigraphy, to ensure there are no weaknesses that could lead to slope failure.

2. **Topographic Analysis:** Evaluation of slope angles, heights, and proximity to water bodies, which may influence the stability and potential for erosion.

3. **Vegetation Cover:** The presence and type of vegetation can play a crucial role in stabilizing slopes. Dense root systems can help hold soil in place, reducing erosion risk.

4. **Hydrological Factors:** Analysis of drainage patterns, groundwater flow, and surface water runoff that might affect slope performance and stability over time.

5. **Historical Data:** Review of past erosion or landslide events in the area, helping to identify slopes that have shown resilience or those that are vulnerable.

6. **Human Impact:** Consideration of nearby human activities, such as construction, landscaping, or agriculture that may affect slope stability through alteration of drainage or vegetation.

Each of these criteria helps delineate areas that can confidently be classified as Long-Term Stable Slope Crests, ensuring that future development projects like the Peacham Crescent can be designed with minimal erosion and stability risks in mind. 

For the most accurate and specific definitions and criteria utilized in the Peacham Crescent projects, consulting the actual project documentation or detailed assessment reports would be necessary.
