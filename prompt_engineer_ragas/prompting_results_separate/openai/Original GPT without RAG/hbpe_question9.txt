To provide a detailed response, I would need more context regarding which specific projects you're referring to. Generally, in project planning and implementation phases, especially for projects involving land use, natural resources, or environmental impact, it is common practice to engage with local Indigenous communities. This might include consultations to seek input, address concerns, and ensure that Indigenous rights and knowledge are respected.

Typically, such engagements can involve:

1. **Public Consultation Meetings**: These may be held to present project plans and gather feedback from community members.
  
2. **Workshops and Focus Groups**: Targeted sessions designed to delve deeper into specific issues or cultural considerations that might affect the projects.

3. **Partnership Agreements**: Formal agreements outlining the roles and contributions of Indigenous communities in the projects.

4. **Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs)**: These documents may specify how the consultations will be conducted and what commitments are made by the project proponent.

5. **Cultural Assessments**: In many cases, there may be an assessment to understand and mitigate impacts on Indigenous heritage and cultural practices.

For a definitive answer, please specify the project or context you are inquiring about.
