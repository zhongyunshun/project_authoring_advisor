In the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, several measures are typically implemented to protect local wildlife, particularly aquatic species, and to minimize disruption. Although specific details may vary depending on the project phase and local regulations, common practices include:

1. **Environmental Assessments**: Conducting comprehensive baseline inventories to identify and assess the presence of aquatic species, their habitats, and overall ecosystem health before any work begins.

2. **Timing Restrictions**: Scheduling construction activities during seasons that minimize impact on sensitive wildlife, particularly during breeding or spawning seasons to protect aquatic life.

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control**: Implementing best management practices to control erosion and sedimentation, which can harm aquatic habitats. This may include silt fences, sediment basins, and other erosion control measures.

4. **Buffer Zones**: Establishing protective buffer zones around critical habitats to limit disturbance. This includes maintaining vegetated areas that separate construction zones from sensitive aquatic environments.

5. **Water Quality Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of water quality during construction to ensure that sediment and pollutants do not negatively impact aquatic species.

6. **Wildlife Relocation**: If necessary, employing specialists to relocate sensitive species away from construction areas to ensure their protection.

7. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Educating the public about the importance of local wildlife and the measures being taken to protect them during the project.

8. **Restoration Efforts**: Planning for habitat restoration post-construction to enhance or restore habitats for aquatic species affected by maintenance activities.

9. **Collaboration with Environmental Agencies**: Working closely with environmental organizations and regulatory bodies to ensure compliance with conservation laws and regulations.

These measures aim to balance developmental needs with environmental stewardship, ensuring the long-term health of local ecosystems.
