The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is structured in three main phases for its design and implementation. According to the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II," here's what we know about the future phases:

1. **Phase I**: This phase has already been initiated and includes preliminary restoration tasks such as seeding and trail repairs along the Eastern Headland. The scope of work focuses on site setup, construction of access routes, and the establishment of erosion control measures.

2. **Phase II**: The current phase under discussion, Phase II, involves further major maintenance and specific works on the Western Headland. This includes extensive site restoration and monitoring efforts after the completion of all three phases, with some preliminary restoration taking place concurrently.

3. **Phase III**: While detailed information on Phase III is not fully elucidated in the retrieved passages, it is indicated that it will involve additional work that complements the preceding phases, particularly concerning the retention of beach materials as part of the structural enhancements being implemented in Phases I and II.

For details on specific tasks and timelines, you may refer to the documents such as the "Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project: Phase II â€“ Western Headland Project Brief."
