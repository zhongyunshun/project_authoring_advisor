The selection of different erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and gravel beaches, in the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief" was guided by their effectiveness in addressing erosion concerns and their environmental impact. 

1. **Effectiveness in Erosion Control**: The identified structures were chosen based on their ability to withstand wave action and protect the shoreline from scouring and displacement. For instance, the armourstone headlands are designed to provide robust protection against wave overtopping and material displacement, as noted in various sections detailing their condition and the need for maintenance or upgrades (Document 3, Document 5).

2. **Environmental Considerations**: The designs aim to minimize excavation and the disturbance of native environmental conditions. The brief mentions that materials like armourstone serve to improve toe and slope stability without extensive alteration of the landscape (Document 5). Additionally, the consideration of smaller cobble sizes for user-friendly beach environments suggests an awareness of ecological impacts, including the balance between user accessibility and maintenance needs (Document 11).

3. **Adaptation to Site Conditions**: The specific choice of structures also reflects adaptations to local shoreline profiles susceptible to flooding and erosion, as indicated in the descriptions of various structures (e.g., WF11.10 and WF11.12) (Document 4, Document 18). The combination of structures was outfitted to minimize water intrusion into areas behind the structures while allowing for natural drainage where feasible (Document 8).

In summary, the erosion control strategies were selected based on a combination of effectiveness in managing erosion and environmental sensitivity, ensuring that the interventions provide long-term benefits while minimizing negative impacts on the surrounding ecosystems.
