The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project aims to address potential social impacts and ensure the safety of the local community through various strategies outlined in the Class EA Project Plan. Here are key measures mentioned in the retrieved documents:

1. **Public Safety Considerations**: The project includes assessments of potential risks to public safety, particularly along trails and the slope. To mitigate these risks, safety features such as fences may be required, and the project assesses the impact of these measures, rating potential effects as low to moderate (Document 3).

2. **Public Consultation**: The project follows the Class Environmental Assessment process, which involves public notifications and consultations. The first point of public contact was through the publication of a Notice of Intent, indicating ongoing communication with local residents and stakeholders to understand their concerns and incorporate feedback (Document 18).

3. **Public Accessibility**: Assessment of property accessibility and impacted infrastructure is a priority. The project recognizes that pedestrian traffic may need to be temporarily restricted to facilitate construction activities, ensuring that public pathways and access routes are managed effectively to minimize disruption (Documents 7 and 9).

4. **Environmental Monitoring**: The project addresses potential impacts on wildlife and vegetation and strives to minimize effects on local ecosystems during construction. Environmental monitoring and control measures are in place to manage sediment and protect watercourses, ensuring that the local environment remains safe and appealing for community use (Documents 6 and 13).

By incorporating these measures, the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project aims to effectively manage social impacts while enhancing safety for the local community.
