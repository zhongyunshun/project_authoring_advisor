The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" outlines several long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies to ensure the durability and effectiveness of the implemented slope stabilization measures. While the complete details may not be fully addressed here, key recommendations typically include:

1. **Regular Inspections**: Establishing a schedule for regular inspections of the stabilization measures to assess their condition and ensure they are performing as intended.

2. **Maintenance of Vegetation**: Implementing periodic maintenance of the vegetation to promote growth and stability, which may involve monitoring plant health and replacing any non-establishing vegetation.

3. **Repair and Rehabilitation**: Prompt repair or rehabilitation of any damaged stabilization elements or erosion control measures to prevent further degradation.

4. **Sediment Control Measures**: Continuing the use of sediment control measures to prevent sediment from entering the watercourse, especially during heavy rains or runoff events.

5. **Public Safety Monitoring**: Ongoing evaluation of public safety risks associated with the slope stabilization project, including any necessary modifications to safety barriers or fencing.

For more detailed recommendations specifically regarding long-term maintenance strategies, it would be beneficial to refer directly to the relevant section of the project brief or related documents.
