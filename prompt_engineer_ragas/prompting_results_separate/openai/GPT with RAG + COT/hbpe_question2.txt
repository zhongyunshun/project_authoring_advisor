The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" outlines a series of measures designed to maintain and enhance the shoreline's ecological health, particularly with regard to local wildlife and aquatic species. Hereâ€™s a summary of potential impacts on aquatic species based on the documents from the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA):

1. **Aquatic Habitat Alteration**: The project recognizes the potential alteration and loss of fish habitats due to construction activities. Detailed assessments of how proposed structures may affect aquatic habitats are conducted to evaluate the areas where fish habitat could be altered or lost (Document 13, Pages 25).

2. **Inventory of Aquatic Species**: Baseline inventories conducted include a range of aquatic species, such as Alewives, White Suckers, Rainbow Smelts, and various native and invasive species. The presence of both native (e.g., Smallmouth Bass, Shorthead Redhorse) and invasive species (e.g., Round Goby) creates a complex ecological environment, which the project aims to assess and protect through careful planning (Document 6, Pages 17; Document 10, Pages 20; Document 14, Pages 18).

3. **Monitoring and Mitigation Measures**: The TRCA has established monitoring protocols to ensure that mitigation measures are in place to protect aquatic habitats. This includes using sediment control measures like silt socks to prevent contamination during construction (Document 16, Pages 33). Additionally, there is a plan for restoration plantings and habitat enhancement post-construction to support the recovery of impacted areas (Document 20, Pages 36).

4. **Collaborative Approaches**: The project involves discussions and cooperation between TRCA, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), and other stakeholders to develop aquatic habitat features that can support diverse species. This collaborative approach underscores the commitment to maintaining ecological integrity while implementing shoreline protection measures (Document 8, Pages 30).

In summary, the shoreline maintenance projects are designed with careful consideration of their impacts on local wildlife, particularly aquatic species. By assessing potential alterations to habitats, employing mitigation measures, and fostering collaboration among stakeholders, the project aims to protect and enhance aquatic ecosystems in the Humber Bay Park East area.
