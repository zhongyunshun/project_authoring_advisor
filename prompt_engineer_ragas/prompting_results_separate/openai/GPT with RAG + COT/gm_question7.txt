The decision-making process behind choosing specific erosion control structures, such as armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches, involves a careful evaluation of their effectiveness in stabilizing shorelines and their environmental impacts.

1. **Assessment of Erosion Risks**: The first consideration in selecting erosion control structures is assessing the erosion risk in specific areas. For example, the design brief indicates that the new revetment structures are designed to stabilize and prevent further erosion along the shoreline. This is especially relevant for areas that have experienced significant erosion, as evidenced by the ongoing issues faced by structures built in the early 1980s.

2. **Structural Stability and Material Selection**: The choice of materials plays a critical role in the effectiveness of erosion control. Armourstone sizes are selected for their stability using established engineering methods like the Hudson equation, with consideration of design coastal conditions. The documents detail that the armour stones used typically range from 2 to 6 tonnes, which can withstand the forces exerted by wave action. Larger stone sizes contribute to enhanced stability and reduced displacement during high-water events.

3. **Environmental Considerations**: The impact of these structures on the local environment is a key aspect of the decision-making process. For instance, the selection of smaller cobble sizes for beach treatments is acknowledged to offer a more user-friendly beach environment but at the cost of higher material requirements and potential maintenance issues. Smaller stones can potentially enhance habitat diversity but may require more extensive landscaping to be effective.

4. **Cost and Maintenance**: Economic factors are also crucial in the decision-making process. The documents recognize the trade-offs between initial installation costs, structural longevity, and ongoing maintenance needs. For instance, while larger stones may provide better protection and durability, they may also be more expensive to install and maintain compared to smaller rubble or cobble treatments.

5. **Regulatory and Stakeholder Input**: The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) plays a significant role in monitoring and providing guidelines for these projects. Their input ensures that decisions regarding the types of erosion control structures are made in compliance with environmental regulations and community needs.

6. **Flexibility and Adaptation**: The ongoing monitoring of existing structures, such as those in the Humber Bay area, leads to adaptations in design and strategy as conditions change. For example, the decisions referenced in the documents were influenced by observed failures and scouring of existing structures, prompting the need for more effective solutions.

In summary, the decision-making process for erosion control structures is multifaceted, considering structural stability, environmental impact, cost-effectiveness, and ongoing monitoring and adaptation based on site conditions. The existing reports and briefs from the TRCA provide valuable insights into these considerations, particularly regarding the use of armourstone and cobble/rubble beaches as viable options for shoreline stabilization.
