To ensure the protection and minimal disruption of local wildlife, particularly aquatic species identified in the baseline inventory during the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, several measures are being implemented as outlined in the project's documentation.

1. **Aquatic Habitat Monitoring**: A baseline inventory was conducted which included fish population data collection using electrofishing at three monitoring stations. This helps to identify and monitor the most common aquatic species in the area, such as Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt (Document 21).

2. **Protection of Native Materials**: The project design emphasizes minimizing cutting and disturbing native materials along the shoreline to protect aquatic habitats from contamination (Document 2).

3. **Construction Precautions**: Erosion and sediment control measures will be taken during construction. For instance, staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated with standard silt socks to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse (Documents 8 and 9).

4. **Vegetation Restoration**: Any disturbed areas due to construction will be restored to existing conditions or better, often involving re-vegetation to support local flora and fauna (Document 12).

5. **Collaboration with Regulatory Bodies**: Discussions are underway between the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), and other stakeholders regarding the development of aquatic habitat features that will enhance local biodiversity (Document 7).

6. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: Following construction, the site will undergo annual inspections as well as assessments after major storm events to ensure that the implemented wildlife protection measures are functioning as intended (Document 22).

These measures collectively aim to safeguard local wildlife, particularly aquatic species, during the course of the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project.
