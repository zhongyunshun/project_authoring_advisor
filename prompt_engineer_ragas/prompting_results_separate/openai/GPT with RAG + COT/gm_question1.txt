The methodology used for "Slope Stability Analysis" in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project was predominantly based on a thorough assessment of the geological and hydrological conditions of the project site, as detailed in the technical documentation provided by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). 

### Methodology for Slope Stability Analysis:

1. **Site Evaluation**: 
   - Initial site assessments included geological surveys to understand the underlying soil types, structure, and hydrology. The analysis specifically focused on areas that had experienced significant slumping and instability, especially following the severe weather event on July 8, 2013.
   
2. **Erosion Risk Assessment**: 
   - The methodology involved risk assessments that outlined the extent and causes of erosion and slope instability at the site, contributing to understanding where the highest risks to human life and property existed.

3. **Slope Stability Modeling**: 
   - Stability analyses were performed using computer modeling techniques, which considered factors such as soil cohesion, angle of internal friction, and the effects of groundwater on slope stability. The TRCA referenced studies, including the Slope Stability & Erosion Risk Assessment by Cole Engineering (2015), to inform the parameters for analysis.

4. **Decision-Making Process**: 
   - The outputs from the slope stability analysis played a crucial role in determining the appropriate remedial solutions. For instance, the results informed the design of structural interventions, like retaining walls or other erosion control measures, to provide long-term protection to the affected properties.

5. **Alternative Assessment**: 
   - Multiple design alternatives were evaluated based on their effectiveness in mitigating slope stability risks, as well as their environmental impacts. The selected approach prioritized solutions that minimized the disturbance to existing vegetation and addressed stormwater management issues.

### Impact on Project Decisions:

The findings from the slope stability analysis were instrumental in shaping the direction of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project. 

- **Risk Mitigation**: The analysis identified areas that required urgent intervention to protect properties and public safety. This influenced decisions on where and how to implement erosion control measures.
  
- **Design Implementation**: The conclusions drawn from the analysis directly impacted the engineering designs and the selection of construction methods intended to stabilize slopes and prevent future erosion.

- **Regulatory Compliance and Community Safety**: By applying a scientific basis to decision-making, the TRCA aimed at not only complying with environmental regulations but also ensuring community safety and enhancing public confidence in the project outcomes.

In summary, the slope stability analysis provided a robust framework for ensuring that the project interventions were based on sound engineering principles and accurately addressed the identified risks and impacts associated with erosion and slope instability within the Peacham Crescent project area.
