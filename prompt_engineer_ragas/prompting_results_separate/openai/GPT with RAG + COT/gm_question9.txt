In the development and implementation of TRCA (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority) projects like those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay, local Indigenous communities are consulted or involved through a structured process of engagement. 

1. **Community Engagement Framework**: TRCA aims to foster positive relationships with Aboriginal communities. This is achieved through processes of meaningful and mutually respectful engagement, acknowledging the unique interests and perspectives of each community (Document 1).

2. **Range of Consultation Methods**: Indigenous engagement can vary significantly depending on the project scope and community interests. The process is designed to provide Indigenous Communities with opportunities to receive information and offer input on project proposals (Document 3).

3. **Consultation Records**: For instance, a full record of Indigenous community consultation related to the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project is documented, indicating systematic communication efforts and responses to concerns raised by these communities (Document 13).

4. **Engagement Specifics**: The documentation outlines specific Indigenous communities that are engaged, such as Beausoleil First Nation, Hiawatha First Nation, and Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, ensuring that diverse voices are represented in consultations (Document 7).

5. **Consultation Activities and Correspondence**: Various methods such as notices of intent, community liaison committees, and direct emails are used to ensure that communities are informed and can provide feedback (Document 17).

6. **Adaptation and Follow-up**: Follow-up communications are also a part of the engagement strategy, allowing TRCA to address any emerging concerns and adjust project plans accordingly (Document 14).

These steps collectively show that the TRCA is committed to integrating Indigenous perspectives into project planning and implementation, highlighting the importance of collaboration in achieving sustainable community development.
