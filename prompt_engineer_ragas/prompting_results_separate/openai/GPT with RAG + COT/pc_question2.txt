Based on the findings from the Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, several measures are proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, particularly concerning species identified in the vicinity:

1. **Minimal Construction Footprint**: The project plans to have the smallest construction footprint possible to minimize disruptions to existing habitats.

2. **Timing of Construction Activities**: All construction activities are scheduled to occur outside of key migration and breeding windows when local wildlife, particularly birds, are most active and dependent on the habitat. This timing is crucial to prevent disturbance during periods of critical habitat use.

3. **Tree Removal Management**: The removal of trees will be minimal and highly selective, which aims to reduce the impact on vegetation communities. Ensuring that most of the tree canopy remains intact will help sustain local wildlife habitats.

4. **Restoration Plans**: A comprehensive restoration plan is set to be developed post-construction to restore any impacted habitats, ensuring the re-establishment of wildlife corridors and native vegetation.

5. **Monitoring and Management**: The project will likely include ongoing environmental monitoring during construction and following restoration efforts to assess the recovery of local habitats and wildlife populations.

6. **Consideration for Species at Risk**: The ecology survey identified existing flora and fauna, and measures will be tailored accordingly to minimize impacts on any species at risk identified during the survey.

These mitigation strategies are integral to the projectâ€™s goal of reducing human impact on local ecosystems while still achieving the erosion control objectives outlined by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA).
