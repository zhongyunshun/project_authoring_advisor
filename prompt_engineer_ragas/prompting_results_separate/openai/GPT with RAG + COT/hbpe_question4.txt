To elaborate on the roles and responsibilities of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and the City of Toronto in the maintenance and administration of Humber Bay Park East, we can refer to information from the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I."

The TRCA's primary role involves overseeing the conservation and sustainable management of the park's natural resources. They are responsible for implementing maintenance projects, as seen in their partnership with Shoreplan Engineering, which provides detailed engineering services to support the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project.

On the other hand, the City of Toronto's responsibilities typically include the management of public access, park amenities, and community engagement. They work in conjunction with TRCA to ensure that the park continues to serve the needs of the public while maintaining ecological integrity.

As detailed in the project's plan and outlined in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I," both organizations collaborate closely to address maintenance strategies, habitat restoration, and community involvement in ongoing park management. The partnership is essential for utilizing expertise effectively and ensuring that the park's development aligns with both conservation goals and community needs.

For further insights about specific roles and contributions, the detailed design and maintenance plans provided in the document are critical. The collaborative nature between TRCA and the City underscores their shared commitment to the sustainability and usability of Humber Bay Park East.

In summary, TRCA primarily focuses on conservation efforts, while the City of Toronto handles public access and engagement aspects, both working together to maintain and enhance the park's value as a public green space.
