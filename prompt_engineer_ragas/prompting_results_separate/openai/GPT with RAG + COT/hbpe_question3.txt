The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several sustainable development practices aimed at ensuring long-term environmental conservation. Here are the key practices highlighted in the retrieved documents:

1. **Phased Implementation**: The project is divided into three phases, allowing for structured and manageable execution while minimizing disruption to the environment and surrounding communities. Each phase is designed to address specific areas of concern related to erosion and ecological health.

2. **Erosion Control Measures**: The project specifically targets existing erosion concerns along the shoreline, with strategies designed to minimize excavation and promote stability. For instance, new materials are placed over existing structures to enhance toe and slope stability, which helps in managing erosion risks without extensive site disruption.

3. **Restoration and Monitoring**: Post-construction monitoring will be conducted, particularly after major storm events, to assess the stability and performance of the implemented works. Annual inspections further ensure that any necessary maintenance is performed promptly to maintain the integrity of the restoration efforts.

4. **Environmental Protection During Construction**: Measures such as tree protection, installing erosion and sediment control (ESC) measures, and relocating bird nesting boxes highlight the project's commitment to environmental stewardship during construction activities.

5. **Native Material Preservation**: When designing protection structures, there is an emphasis on minimizing disturbance to native material along the shoreline, which is essential for maintaining the ecological integrity of the area.

6. **Climate Change Considerations**: The project acknowledges the implications of climate change, such as fluctuating water levels and increased storm intensity. This recognition informs the design decisions to enhance resilience against future climate impacts.

These practices reflect a comprehensive approach to sustainable development, balancing infrastructure needs with ecological preservation in the Humber Bay Park East area.
