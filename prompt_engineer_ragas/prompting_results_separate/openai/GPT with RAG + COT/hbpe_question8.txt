The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" outlines several long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the newly installed erosion control measures. Here are the key strategies:

1. **Post-Construction Monitoring**: The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and annually thereafter. This monitoring is to ensure that the installed erosion control measures are stable and performing as designed.

2. **Regular Inspections**: Following major storm events, inspections during the first year will assess the effectiveness of the erosion control measures. Any required maintenance will be undertaken based on these inspections.

3. **Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Measures**: The brief emphasizes that these measures will be implemented prior to and maintained throughout the construction phases to prevent sediment entry into adjacent water bodies. Damaged or defective ESC measures should be repaired or replaced within 48 hours.

4. **Adaptive Management**: The erosion and sediment control strategies are not static; they may be updated or amended as site conditions change to minimize sediment-laden runoff. If existing measures are ineffective, alternative measures must be implemented immediately to prevent ecological impacts.

5. **Monitoring of Vegetation**: After planting, monitoring of the proposed vegetation will be conducted for two years to ensure that it is surviving well.

6. **Reporting and Documentation**: Regular documentation and reporting of monitoring activities will occur, which includes photographic records of the pre-and post-construction phases and ongoing maintenance work.

These strategies aim to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the erosion control measures and the protection of ecological health in the Humber Bay Park East area.
