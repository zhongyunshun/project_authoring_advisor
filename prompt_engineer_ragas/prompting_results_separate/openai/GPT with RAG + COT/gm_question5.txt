The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project has indeed been divided into multiple phases to address its extensive nature and the need for long-term management of erosion and maintenance concerns. As indicated in the retrieved documents, the project is structured into three phases for design and implementation, with ongoing evaluations to ensure effective erosion control and slope stabilization.

Furthermore, the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project also follows a phased approach, suggesting that continuous assessments and potential future phases may be considered to improve and stabilize the area over time. The documents indicate that these projects are likely to expand or evolve based on the outcomes of the phases already planned.

In summary, both projects have established a phased approach, laying the groundwork for potential future expansions or additional phases focused on ensuring effective erosion control and habitat preservation.
