The engagement of Indigenous communities in the planning and decision-making processes for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project involved several steps and outcomes outlined in the documents provided by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA).

1. **Consultation Process**: The TRCA conducted a thorough consultation process with various Indigenous communities, which included notifying groups and holding consultations. The first point of public contact was the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018, followed by notices sent to community groups, homeowners in the vicinity, and Indigenous communities (Document 2).

2. **Documentation of Engagement**: A comprehensive record of the Indigenous community consultation, which includes all correspondence, is documented in the Record of Indigenous Engagement for the project (Document 1). This record is crucial for ensuring that all interactions and feedback from these communities were captured and taken into consideration during the planning process.

3. **Concerns Raised**: According to the documentation, there have been no major concerns raised about the project from the Indigenous communities. It implies that the consultation process was largely effective in addressing any potential issues or queries the communities might have had (Document 1).

4. **Summary of Group Consultations**: The summaries from the consultations indicate which Indigenous groups were engaged, including but not limited to:
   - Beausoleil First Nation
   - Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation
   - Chippewas of Rama-Mnjikaning First Nation
   - Huron-Wendat Nation
   - Various other First Nations (Document 3).

5. **Outcomes**: The absence of major concerns suggests that the engagement was fruitful, fostering a collaborative dialogue that may have led to mutual understanding and support for the project. Moreover, feedback gathered during this engagement was likely instrumental in shaping the decision-making processes and ensuring that indigenous perspectives were integrated into the planning of the erosion control and slope stabilization efforts.

In short, the Indigenous consultation for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project was systematic and well-documented, resulting in effective communication and an absence of significant concerns from the Indigenous communities involved.
