The "Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project" aims to mitigate the risks associated with valley slope erosion, specifically to protect human life and property within the affected area. Here are the anticipated environmental and social impacts as well as the proposed measures to address these impacts based on the excerpts from the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP":

### Anticipated Environmental Impacts:

1. **Wildlife and Habitat**: 
   - There are no significant wildlife populations or unique landforms identified within the project limits, which suggests minimal direct impacts on wildlife habitats (Document 9, Page 28; Document 10, Page 23). 
   - Potential impacts may arise from construction activities, but the plan aims to minimize the construction footprint and schedule activities outside critical periods for wildlife (Document 18, Page 26).

2. **Vegetation and Soil**:
   - The project considers existing vegetation and drainage concerns, with a focus on minimizing soil removal and maintaining vegetation during construction (Document 8, Page 44).

3. **Public Safety**:
   - Concerns regarding public safety due to the proximity of the trail and slope, which could pose risks during and after the project (Document 11, Page 42).

4. **Cultural and Historical Aspects**: 
   - No significant cultural heritage or historic canals are noted near the project site, thus limiting associated impacts (Document 22, Page 30).

### Anticipated Social Impacts:

1. **Community Engagement and Communication**:
   - The initial public notification occurred on November 22, 2018, indicating community outreach efforts to inform local residents, groups, and Indigenous communities about the project (Document 4, Page 48).

2. **Infrastructure**:
   - Accessibility issues may arise during construction, with considerations for routes to manage access behind residential properties impacted by the project (Document 6, Page 37).

### Measures Proposed to Address Impacts:

1. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - The Class EA proposes a comprehensive approach that includes detailed environmental analysis to ensure impacts are reduced. This includes designing construction activities to occur when they will least disrupt wildlife (Document 18, Page 26).
   
2. **Public Safety Features**:
   - Installation of safety features, such as fences along trails, to safeguard the public is outlined to address health and safety concerns (Document 11, Page 42).

3. **Community Involvement**:
   - The inclusion of community groups and residents in the planning process helps address social impacts and ensure that local concerns are acknowledged (Document 4, Page 48).

4. **Compliance with Environmental Standards**:
   - The overall project adheres to guidelines under the Conservation Authorities Act and the Class Environmental Assessment for Remedial Flood and Erosion Control Projects, ensuring long-term low-maintenance solutions for affected properties (Document 5, Page 3).

In summary, the project is designed to carefully manage and mitigate potential environmental and social impacts while prioritizing public safety and community involvement throughout the process.
