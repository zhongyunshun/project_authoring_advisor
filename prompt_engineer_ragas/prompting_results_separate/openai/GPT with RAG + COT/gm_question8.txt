The long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects like the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project include regular site inspections and assessments. Specifically, the post-construction monitoring programs indicate that the site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and on an annual basis thereafter. This approach is intended to ensure that the erosion control measures remain stable and perform as designed. Any maintenance deemed necessary based on these inspections will be carried out to address identified issues and sustain the functionality of the structures (Source: Document 1, Document 2). 

Additionally, during the construction phase, sediment control measures are put in place, such as using silt socks to prevent contaminants from entering the watercourse (Source: Document 9, Document 13). These practices highlight a comprehensive strategy to manage both immediate impacts and long-term stability of the shoreline protection measures.

For further reference, the detailed procedures and findings can be found within the embedded monitoring frameworks of the project brief documents (e.g., "Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project â€“ Concept Brief" and related documents).
