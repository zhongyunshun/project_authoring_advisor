The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" provides several measures to address potential impacts on biodiversity with a particular focus on bat species and butternut trees within the project area.

1. **Butternut Trees**: The project identifies a Category 2 butternut tree located along the access route. This classification indicates that the tree is either not significantly affected by the Butternut Canker disease or is affected to a lesser degree. The project brief emphasizes the importance of preserving this tree, highlighting its status as a protected species under Ontario's Endangered Species Act. It notes that additional measures will be taken to mitigate any potential harm during construction activities.

2. **Bat Species**: The document notes the presence of bat habitat within the project site. It mentions that appropriate compensation strategies will be coordinated by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authorityâ€™s Environmental Resource Management (ERM) staff. This approach aligns with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks' guidelines, ensuring that mitigation measures for bats are in place. 

3. **Minimized Impacts**: The project plans to conduct tree removals selectively and minimally to avoid negative effects on the surrounding ecosystem. Construction activities are scheduled to occur outside of critical periods for wildlife, such as the bird breeding season, to further reduce impacts on local biodiversity.

In summary, the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" demonstrates a proactive approach to biodiversity conservation by implementing targeted measures to protect both bat species and butternut trees identified within the vicinity of the project. These efforts reflect a commitment to comply with ecological guidelines and enhance biodiversity in the area.
