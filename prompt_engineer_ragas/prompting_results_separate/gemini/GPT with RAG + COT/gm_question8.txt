Okay, I will analyze the provided documents to identify the long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for the erosion control measures at Humber Bay Park East.

**Answer:**

The documents outline post-construction monitoring strategies to ensure the stability and performance of the implemented erosion control works at Humber Bay Park East. This monitoring includes:

*   **Annual Inspections:** The sites are inspected on an annual basis to ensure the implemented works are stable and performing as designed (Document 1, Document 2).
*   **Storm Event Inspections:** Inspections are also conducted during the first year after major storm events to assess the impact of the storms on the structures (Document 1, Document 2).
*   **Maintenance:** Any maintenance required based on the inspections will be addressed (Document 1, Document 2).

The overall goal of the maintenance project is to return the erosion control structures to a state of good repair and provide long-term protection to the Humber Bay Park East shoreline (Document 10). The concept brief addresses erosion concerns such as low crest elevation and wave overtopping (Document 3).
