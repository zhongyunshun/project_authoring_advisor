#### How does the slope stabilization project on Peacham Crescent plan to address potential social impacts and ensure the safety of the local community ####

The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project addresses potential social impacts and ensures the safety of the local community through the following measures:

*   **Public Safety:** The project considers the potential risks to the public, particularly along the trail and slope, and includes requirements for safety features such as safety fences (Document 3).

*   **Pedestrian Traffic:** During construction, pedestrian traffic will be temporarily restricted along the paved pathway that runs through the parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent (Document 9).

*   **Public Notifications and Consultation:** The project involves public consultation, beginning with the publication of a Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018. Notices were sent to community groups, homeowners in the vicinity, and Indigenous communities (Document 18).

*   **Risk Mitigation:** The primary purpose of the project is to protect human life and property from erosion and slope instability hazards (Document 5, Document 14, Document 21).

These measures aim to minimize disruption, ensure public safety during and after construction, and address any concerns from the local community and other stakeholders.
