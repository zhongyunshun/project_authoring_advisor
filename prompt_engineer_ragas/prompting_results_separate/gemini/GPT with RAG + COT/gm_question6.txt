The German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection project aims to address potential social impacts related to park access and recreational spaces through several considerations:

*   **Maintaining Public Safety During Construction:** Ensuring public safety is a key consideration. The project evaluates design alternatives with respect to potential risks to trail and park users, including the need for safety features such as fences. (Document 7)

*   **Preserving Public Enjoyment:** One of the secondary objectives of the project is to enhance the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic habitat of German Mills Park while preserving the public enjoyment of the natural space. (Document 3)

*   **Minimizing Disruption:** Erosion and sediment control measures, such as sediment fencing around staging and stockpiling areas, are implemented before construction to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse. (Document 6)

*   **Providing Long-Term Solutions:** The project aims to provide a long-term solution for the protection of regional sanitary infrastructure as well as City stormwater and trail infrastructure, which helps maintain access and recreational opportunities in the long run. (Document 18)

*   **Assessing Social and Cultural Environment:** The project considers the benefits and detriments to the social and cultural environment when evaluating alternatives. (Document 21)

These measures collectively aim to balance the need for infrastructure protection with the community's use and enjoyment of the park.
