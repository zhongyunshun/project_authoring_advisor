Here's a breakdown of the measures being taken to protect local wildlife during the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, based on the provided documents:

*   **Aquatic Habitat Considerations:** Discussions are underway between TRCA, DFO (Fisheries and Oceans Canada), City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design. The proposed habitat component consists of a surcharged revetment (Document 7).
*   **Minimizing Disturbance:** The project design aims to minimize cutting and disturbing native material along the shoreline, assuming potential contamination (Document 2).
*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated with silt socks to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse (Documents 8 & 9).
*   **Tree Protection:** Tree protection barriers will be erected where necessary, avoiding grade changes and storage of materials/equipment within the Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) (Document 12).
*   **Habitat Restoration:** Disturbed areas are to be restored to existing conditions or better and will be vegetated (Document 12).
*   **Aquatic Inventory and Habitat:** TRCA's Aquatic Monitoring and Management (AMM) Group regularly collects fish population data using electrofishing at three monitoring stations near Humber Bay Park East: Southern Beach, East Headland (Document 21).
*   **Monitoring:** Post-construction monitoring will occur during the first year after major storm events and annually thereafter to ensure the implemented works are stable and performing as designed (Document 22).

**Aquatic Species Identified:**

*   Alewives
*   White Suckers
*   Rainbow Smelt (Document 1)
*   Round Goby (Invasive)
*   Shorthead Redhorse
*   Smallmouth Bass
