The German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project involves several stakeholders with distinct roles:

*   **Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA):** TRCA is a key partner in the project, working with the Regional Municipality of York to undertake sanitary infrastructure protection works. TRCA's Infrastructure Hazard Monitoring Program (IHMP) identified and monitored at-risk sanitary sites along German Mills Creek.TRCA is responsible for completing the Schedule B Municipal Class Environmental Assessment (MCEA) Project File.

*   **Regional Municipality of York (the "Region"):** York Region Environmental Services collaborates with TRCA in preparing sanitary infrastructure protection works.

*   **GRECK AND ASSOCIATES LIMITED:** This engineering firm is involved in the Schedule B Municipal Class Environmental Assessment, specifically in the evaluation of alternatives for sites 2 and 3.

*   **Palmer Environmental Consulting Group:** This group worked with Greck and Associates Limited on the Bercy Wycliffe Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project, producing a Geomorphic Assessment and Preliminary Design Alternatives report.

*   **Indigenous Communities:** TRCA engages with Indigenous communities during the project.

The project aims to prevent the exposure of the Leslie Collector sewer within German Mills Creek and address erosion issues along the creek within German Mills Settlers Park. The project area is located along an estimated 260-meter stretch of German Mills Creek, between John Street and Steeles Avenue East, in the City of Markham.
