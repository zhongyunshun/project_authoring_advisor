The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" outlines several ways in which the shoreline maintenance projects impact local wildlife, particularly aquatic species:

*   **Aquatic Habitat Alteration & Loss:** The construction activities can lead to the alteration or loss of fish habitat. The effect of the proposed structure on aquatic habitat was evaluated in plan view to calculate the areas of fish habitat that would be altered or lost as a result of the construction. \[Document 3, page 25; Document 22, page 4]
*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Measures such as silt socks are used to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse during construction. \[Document 16, page 33]
*   **Habitat Features:** The project includes the development of aquatic habitat features, such as a surcharged revetment. Habitat features were installed as part of Phase I, consisting of surcharged stone at the base of the revetment at several points along the deepest part of the structure. A similar approach is planned for Phase II. \[Document 8, page 30; Document 18, page 30]
*   **Baseline Inventory:** The baseline inventory includes a list of fish species found in the area, such as Alewives, White Suckers, Rainbow Smelt, Round Goby, Shorthead Redhorse, and Smallmouth Bass. \[Document 1, page 14; Document 10, page 20; Document 14, page 18]
*   **Site Restoration and Monitoring:** Final site restoration will occur following completion of all three phases of the project, with the exception of some preliminary restoration along the Eastern Headland (seeding and trail repairs) following completion of. \[Document 17, page 35]
*   **Planting Plan:** As part of the Phase II preliminary planting plan, 152 on-site compensation plantings of at least 50 mm caliper are proposed to mitigate the project impacts. \[Document 20, page 36]
