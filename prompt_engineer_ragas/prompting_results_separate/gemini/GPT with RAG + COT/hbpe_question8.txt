#### What long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies are outlined for the newly installed erosion control measures in projects such as the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" ####

The following long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies are outlined for erosion control measures, as indicated in the provided documents:

*   **Post-Construction Monitoring:** Sites will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and annually thereafter to ensure the implemented works are stable and performing as designed. Any required maintenance will be performed. (Document 1, Document 2)
*   **Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Measures Maintenance:** ESC measures will be implemented prior to and maintained during construction phases to prevent sediment entry into the water. Damaged ESC measures should be repaired or replaced within 48 hours of inspection. (Document 5, Document 15)
*   **Site Restoration and Monitoring:** Restoration includes regrading and seeding. Monitoring of proposed vegetation should be conducted for two years after planting to ensure survivability. (Document 7, Document 9)
*   **Regular Monitoring During Construction:** Trained professionals will conduct regular monitoring during construction to ensure best management practices are used to minimize disturbance to the environment. (Document 15)
*   **Long-Term Protection:** Provide long-term, low-maintenance protection against erosion. (Document 12)
