The decision-making process behind choosing specific erosion control structures like armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches involves considering their effectiveness, environmental impact, cost, and user accessibility. Here's a breakdown based on the provided documents:

*   **Effectiveness:**

    *   Armour stone revetments are used to stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. The size of the armour stones is selected based on the Hudson equation, considering design coastal conditions.  The existing armour stone may be supplemented with additional armour stone to raise the structure to a higher elevation.

    *   Revetments and headlands are used to protect shorelines from erosion.

    *   Cobble beaches offer a user-friendly environment but may require more material and maintenance than larger stone treatments.

*   **Environmental Impact:**

    *   Minimizing disturbance to the shoreline is a key consideration. Supplementing existing structures with additional armour stone (Option 2) is preferred over complete rebuilds (Option 1) to reduce disturbance and potential exposure of fill material.

    *   The use of smaller cobble sizes on beaches may have a greater in-water footprint.

    *   Designs are updated to preserve fish habitat by transitioning from a revetment to an embayment/headland structure.

*   **Cost:**

    *   Treatments using smaller cobble sizes can have higher costs.

    *   Vegetated boulder revetments are considered a more cost-efficient means of protection.

*   **User Accessibility:**

    *   Smaller cobble sizes are preferred for beaches to create a more user-friendly environment.

    *   Scouring due to wave overtopping can place park paths and benches at risk.
