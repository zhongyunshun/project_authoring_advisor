The "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief" outlines a major maintenance project addressing erosion concerns, but it doesn't explicitly detail the *selection process* of different erosion control structures based on a comparative analysis of their effectiveness and environmental impact. However, the document does provide insights into the considerations that influence the choice of materials and designs.

Here's what can be inferred from the provided documents:

*   **Addressing Erosion Concerns:** The project aims to address "leading erosion concerns of the park, including low crest elevation and wave overtopping" (Document 5).
*   **Material Selection Considerations:** The choice of materials, like cobble size for the beach, balances user experience with shoreline protection. Smaller cobbles are more user-friendly but may require more material and maintenance (Document 11).
*   **Minimizing Environmental Impact:** The designs aim to minimize excavation and disturbance of native material, suggesting a consideration for aquatic habitat and potential contamination (Document 5, 19).
*   **Structural Condition:** The existing condition of the structures (WF11.10, WF11.11, WF11.12) informs the type of intervention needed, ranging from repair to complete redesign (Document 3, 18).

It appears the choice of specific erosion control structures is driven by a combination of factors: the existing structural deficiencies, the need to mitigate specific erosion problems (wave overtopping, scouring), user accessibility, cost considerations, and a desire to minimize environmental disruption. A direct comparison of different structure types based on quantified effectiveness and environmental impact isn't explicitly presented in these documents.
