Okay, I will analyze the provided documents to identify the anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, and how the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" addresses them.

**Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures:**

*   **Wildlife Habitat:** The project considers impacts on wildlife habitat, habitat linkages, and significant vegetation communities. (Document 1). The document notes that construction activities will be planned to have the smallest possible footprint and occur outside key migration and breeding windows to minimize impacts on existing natural habitat. A comprehensive restoration plan will also be implemented (Document 18).

*   **Wetlands:** Wetland vegetation communities were observed along the southern limits of the project area (Document 9).

*   **Unique Landforms:** The project finds that there are no known unique landforms within or adjacent to the project limits, so no impacts are expected (Document 10, 12).

*   **Riparian Uses:** The project finds that there are no significant riparian uses within the project limits, so no impacts are expected (Document 13).

*   **Erosion:** The project aims to provide long-term, low-maintenance protection against valley slope erosion, addressing the hazards to human life and property (Document 3). The rate of erosion is influenced by surrounding land use (Document 19). The project also aims to address drainage and stormwater runoff concerns (Document 8).

**Social Impacts and Mitigation Measures:**

*   **Public Consultation:** Public notification and consultation occurred, starting with the Notice of Intent published on November 22, 2018. Notices were sent to community groups, homeowners in the vicinity, and Indigenous communities (Document 4).

*   **Property Accessibility:** The project considers access route options to the slope behind specific properties (Document 6).

*   **Tourism:** There are no existing tourism operations within or adjacent to the project limits, so no impacts are anticipated (Document 6).

*   **Surrounding Neighbourhood:** The project considers the surrounding neighborhood and community (Document 7).

*   **Recreational Uses:** The parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent is actively used for recreational purposes (Document 13).

*   **Public Safety:** The project considers potential risks to public safety along trails and the slope and the requirement for safety features (Document 11).

**Overall Project Objectives:**

*   The primary objective is to protect human life and property from the hazards of valley slope erosion (Document 3, 5).
*   The project aims to provide long-term, low-maintenance protection (Document 3, 5).
*   The project aims to reduce risk to life and property, as per the mandate of Conservation Authorities under the Conservation Authorities Act (R.S.O 1990) (Document 5).

**Preferred Alternative:**

*   The selected alternative should have less impact on existing vegetation and excess soil removal (Document 8).

**Additional Considerations:**

*   The project is being completed in accordance with the Class Environmental Assessment for Remedial Flood and Erosion Control Projects, amended 2013 (Class EA) (Document 5).
*   The project planning process follows the Class EA planning process, including developing a full range of alternatives (Document 16).

**In Summary:** The "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" identifies potential environmental impacts related to wildlife habitat, wetlands, and erosion. Social impacts related to public safety, property access, recreation, and the surrounding neighborhood are also considered. The plan proposes mitigation measures such as minimizing the construction footprint, conducting work outside key migration/breeding windows, implementing a restoration plan, and engaging in public consultation. The project's primary objective is to protect human life and property from erosion hazards while adhering to the Class EA process.
