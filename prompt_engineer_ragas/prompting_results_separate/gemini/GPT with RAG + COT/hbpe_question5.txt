The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is being implemented in three phases:

*   **Phase I:** Focuses on the Eastern Headland (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf).
*   **Phase II:** Focuses on the Western Headland (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf). Specific work includes major maintenance to ensure long-term stability (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 24).
*   **Phase III:** Includes placing beach material to the east of a structure installed during Phase II (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 27). Final site restoration will occur following completion of all three phases (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 35).
