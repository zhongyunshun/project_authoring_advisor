Okay, I will analyze the provided documents and, if necessary, supplement with web searches and my own knowledge to answer the query about sustainable development and conservation strategies in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, as outlined in the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief".

Based on the provided documents:

The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" mentions the following strategies that relate to sustainable development and conservation:

*   **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures:** Document 12 states that prior to construction, the work area will be isolated with standard sediment control fencing to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse. The barriers will be inspected and maintained throughout construction until the site is stabilized. This aims to protect water quality and prevent sediment runoff.

*   **Tree Removals and Hazardous Plants Screening:** Document 13 mentions "Required Tree Removals" and "Hazardous Plants Screening" implying an assessment of the impact on vegetation and a plan to manage any hazardous plants. This suggests an effort to minimize ecological disruption.

*   **Utility Locates and Sewer Infrastructure:** Document 21 discusses locating underground utilities and confirming the absence of sewer infrastructure within the project limits. This indicates a concern for avoiding damage to existing infrastructure during construction, which indirectly contributes to sustainable practices by preventing potential environmental hazards from damaged utilities.

While these points address specific environmental protection measures, the provided extracts from the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" do not explicitly detail a comprehensive sustainable development strategy. The focus appears to be on mitigating immediate environmental risks during construction.

It's possible that further details on sustainable development and conservation strategies are available in other sections of the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" or in the "Detailed Design Brief (Terraprobe, 2020)" referenced in Document 6 and Document 21, which are not included in the provided excerpts.
