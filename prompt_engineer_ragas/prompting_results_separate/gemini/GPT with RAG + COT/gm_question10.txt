The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project involves tree removals and restoration plantings, with implications for biodiversity, including species at risk like butternut trees. Here's a breakdown of how these activities contribute to or mitigate against biodiversity loss:

**Tree Removals and Impacts:**

*   **Extent of Removals:** To facilitate construction access for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, 180 trees are slated for removal, and another 38 are expected to be injured. (Document 12)
*   **Habitat Impact:** The removal of canopy trees could have minimal impacts on bird habitat. Construction activities are planned to occur outside the bird breeding window to mitigate these impacts. (Document 13)
*   **Selective Removal:** Tree or shrub removals are planned to be highly selective to minimize the impact on species of concern. (Document 8)

**Restoration Plantings and Mitigation:**

*   **Species Selection:** Post-construction restoration activities focus on replanting suitable native species to compensate for those removed and enhance the overall biodiversity. (Document 8)
*   **Ecological Gains:** While buckthorn are recognized, ecological gain is expected from improving native species representation through restoration plantings. (Document 9)
*   **Soil Stabilization and Biodiversity:** Planted vegetation will increase soil stabilization, reduce surficial erosion, and contribute to the biodiversity of the local ecosystem once established. (Document 6)

**Butternut Trees:**

*   **Endangered Status:** Butternut trees are classified as an endangered species in North America and are protected under Ontarioâ€™s Endangered Species Act. (Document 1)
*   **Genetic Testing:** A genetic test was conducted on a butternut tree within the construction access route, determining it to be genetically pure and highly susceptible to butternut canker. (Document 1)
*   **Category 2 Butternut:** A Category 2 butternut (affected by butternut canker but not to an advanced degree) was identified within the project area along the proposed access route. (Document 2)
*   **Protection/Recovery:** Retaining the tree could support the protection or recovery of butternut in the area. (Document 21)

**Overall Assessment:**

The project aims to minimize impacts through careful planning, selective tree removals, and comprehensive restoration efforts. While some tree removal is unavoidable, the focus on native species in replanting and the specific consideration for butternut trees (an endangered species) are intended to mitigate biodiversity loss and enhance the local ecosystem.
