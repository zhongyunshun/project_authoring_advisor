Based on the provided documents related to the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, here's an outline of the long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies recommended, specifically drawing from the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" documents:

**Analysis:**

While the provided excerpts from the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" do not explicitly detail specific long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies, they do reference key aspects that imply the need for such strategies:

*   **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures:** Document 3 mentions the use of sediment control fencing during construction, emphasizing the need for inspection and maintenance throughout the construction duration. This suggests that post-construction monitoring for erosion and sediment control is also important.
*   **Remediation Design:** Document 6 refers to Section 5 of the Detailed Design Brief (Terraprobe, 2020) for details on the scope of work and design rationale. This section likely contains information regarding long-term performance expectations and associated monitoring needs.
*   **Tree Removals and Hazardous Plants Screening:** Document 21 indicates consideration of tree removals and hazardous plants. This suggests that vegetation management will be a component of long-term maintenance.

**In summary, while the documents don't offer explicit details, the following can be inferred:**

1.  **Erosion and Sediment Control Monitoring:** Regular inspections to ensure the continued effectiveness of erosion control measures, particularly after significant rainfall events.
2.  **Vegetation Management:** Periodic maintenance of vegetation to ensure it becomes well-established and contributes to slope stability (as mentioned in Document 10 from the 2019 plan). This would include monitoring vegetation health, managing invasive species, and potentially replanting as needed.
3.  **Structural Inspections:** Regular inspections of the implemented slope stabilization structure (likely an MSE structure, as per Document 10) to identify any signs of deterioration, displacement, or structural issues.
4.  **Drainage System Maintenance:** Ensuring that drainage systems are functioning correctly to prevent water buildup and potential erosion.

To get the detailed monitoring and maintenance strategies, refer to Section 5 of the Detailed Design Brief (Terraprobe, 2020).
