#### In light of the findings from the Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, what specific measures are proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, especially concerning species identified in the vicinity? ####
Based on the provided documents related to the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, here's a summary of the measures proposed to mitigate impacts on local wildlife:

*   **Limited Impacts:** The project area has no significant wildlife populations identified within the project limits; therefore, no anticipated impacts resulting from the proposed works (Document 1).
*   **Timing of Construction:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest construction footprint as possible and occur outside of key migration and breeding windows when habitat use is not as crucial (Document 3).
*   **Bird Habitat:** Construction activities will occur outside of the bird breeding window to avoid impacting breeding bird activities. The project will result in minimal impacts to bird habitat through the removal of select canopy trees (Document 18).
*   **Sediment Control:** Prior to the start of construction, the Work Area will be isolated with standard sediment control fencing to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse (Document 8).
*   **Vegetation:** Minimal and highly selective removal of vegetation with no overall impact to the welfare of vegetation communities (Document 13).
*   **Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented to minimize impacts on existing natural habitat (Document 3).
