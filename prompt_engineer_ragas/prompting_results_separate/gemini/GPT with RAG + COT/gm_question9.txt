#### In the development and implementation of TRCA projects like those at Peacham Crescent and Humber Bay, how are local Indigenous communities consulted or involved? ####

The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) engages with local Indigenous communities in several ways during the development and implementation of projects:

*   **Meaningful Engagement:** TRCA aims to develop positive relationships with Aboriginal communities whose interests may be impacted by TRCA projects, through a process of meaningful and mutually respectful engagement (Document 1).

*   **Varied Forms of Engagement:** Recognizing that Indigenous communities have diverse views and experiences, engagement may take different forms depending on the project's scope and the community's interests (Document 3).

*   **Opportunity for Input:** Indigenous engagement provides communities with the opportunity to receive information about and provide input to project proposals. It also allows TRCA to identify and address potential concerns (Document 3).

*   **Consultation with Specific Communities:** TRCA consults with various First Nations and Indigenous communities, including (but not limited to) Beausoleil First Nation, Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, Chippewas of Rama-Mnjikaning First Nation, Conseil de la Nation Huronne-Wendat, Curve Lake First Nation, Hiawatha First Nation, Mississaugas of Alderville First Nation, Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, and Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation (Document 7).

*   **Notification and Consultation:** Notices are sent to Indigenous communities regarding projects (Document 19).

*   **Addressing Concerns:** TRCA addresses concerns raised by Indigenous communities during the consultation process (Document 13).

*   **Archaeological Assessments:** Completed archaeological assessments are shared with interested Indigenous communities (Document 22).

*   **Overlapping Territories:** TRCA recognizes the importance of consulting with Aboriginal communities on planning matters that may affect their rights and interests, acknowledging that their jurisdiction contains many overlapping traditional territories and Treaty areas (Document 11).
