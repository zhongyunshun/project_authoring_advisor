#### What sustainable development practices are being implemented in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project to ensure long-term environmental conservation? ####

Based on the provided documents, here are some sustainable development practices being implemented in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project:

*   **Minimizing Excavation:** The proposed concepts are designed to address erosion concerns by placing new material over existing structures where toe and slope stability permits, thereby minimizing excavation requirements. (Document 6)

*   **Protection of Native Material:** The protection structures were designed to minimize cutting and disturbing of native material, considering the potential for contamination. (Document 17)

*   **Site Restoration:** Restoration efforts include regrading and seeding in Phase I, with a full Restoration Plan to be part of the detailed designs for the final phase of the project, including plantings after implementation. (Document 22)

*   **Post-Construction Monitoring:** The site will be inspected during the first year after major storm events and annually thereafter to ensure the implemented works are stable and performing as designed. (Documents 12, 18)

*   **Addressing Climate Change:** The project considers the effects of climate change on the Great Lakes, including water levels and storm frequency. (Documents 14, 15)
