Okay, I will analyze the provided documents to explain the methodology used for the "Slope Stability Analysis" in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project and its impact on project decisions.

Based on the provided documents:

*   **Cole Engineering's Role:** Cole Engineering Group Ltd. conducted a "Slope Stability & Erosion Risk Assessment" for the area (Document 1, Document 16). The specific report referenced is titled "Slope Stability & Erosion Risk Assessment â€“ Area E Properties, City of Toronto WR14-0072" (Document 16).

*   **Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC):** The location of the projected long-term stable slope crest (LTSSC) is a key consideration in relation to permanent and essential structures at the top of the slope (Document 4). Figure 7 in the "Class EA Project Plan" illustrates the LTSSC projected behind Peacham Crescent with a factor of safety of 1.5 (Document 10).

*   **Factor of Safety:** A factor of safety of 1.5 is mentioned in relation to the LTSSC (Document 10). This indicates a quantitative approach to assessing slope stability.

*   **Project Objectives:** The selected alternative for the project must meet the objectives, including risk mitigation (Document 9). This means the slope stability analysis directly informs the choice of stabilization methods.

*   **Remediation Design:** The "Detailed Design Brief (Terraprobe, 2020)" includes a section on Remediation Design, which likely incorporates the findings of the slope stability analysis (Document 12).

**Summary of Methodology and Impact on Decisions:**

The methodology for slope stability analysis in the Peacham Crescent project involves:

1.  **Assessment by Cole Engineering:** A specialized firm (Cole Engineering) performed a detailed assessment of slope stability and erosion risk.
2.  **LTSSC Projection:** Projecting the Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC) is a crucial step.
3.  **Factor of Safety Calculation:** A factor of safety (1.5 is mentioned) is calculated, providing a quantitative measure of slope stability.
4.  **Consideration of Infrastructure:** The location of the LTSSC is considered in relation to existing infrastructure.
5.  **Remediation Design:** The analysis informs the remediation design, as referenced in Terraprobe's design brief.

The slope stability analysis directly impacts project decisions by:

*   **Defining Project Objectives:** Ensuring the chosen stabilization method mitigates risk and meets project objectives.
*   **Selecting Stabilization Alternatives:** The analysis helps in evaluating different stabilization alternatives.
*   **Informing Design:** The analysis informs the detailed design of the chosen remediation strategy.
