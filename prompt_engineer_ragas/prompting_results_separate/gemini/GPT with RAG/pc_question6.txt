Based on the provided documents from the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP," here's a summary of the anticipated environmental and social impacts of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project and the proposed methods to address them:

**Environmental Impacts:**

*   **Wildlife Habitat:** The project considers potential effects on wildlife habitat (Document 1). The project aims to minimize impacts by having the smallest construction footprint possible and working outside of key migration and breeding windows (Document 18).
*   **Habitat Linkages/Corridors:** The project also considers potential impacts to habitat linkages or corridors (Document 1).
*   **Significant Vegetation Communities:** The project considers potential effects on significant vegetation communities (Document 1).  The preferred alternative is selected because it has less impact on existing vegetation (Document 8). A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented to minimize impacts (Document 18).
*   **Wetlands:** There were two wetland vegetation communities observed along the southern limits of the project area (Document 9).
*   **Unique Landforms:** The document states there are no known unique landforms within or adjacent to the project limits, so no impacts are anticipated (Document 10, 12).
*   **Erosion and Slope Instability:** The project directly addresses this issue, aiming to provide long-term, low-maintenance protection from valley slope erosion (Document 3). The potential for erosion is influenced by surrounding land use (Document 19).
*   **Drainage and Stormwater Runoff:** The selected alternative provides an opportunity to address drainage and stormwater runoff concerns (Document 8).

**Social Impacts:**

*   **Public Safety:** The project aims to reduce risk to life and property (Document 5, 8).  Public safety is a key consideration, assessing potential risks to the public (along trails and the slope) and the need for safety features (Document 11).
*   **Property Accessibility:** The document discusses access route options to the slope behind specific properties (Document 6).
*   **Surrounding Neighborhood/Community:** The project considers potential effects on the surrounding neighborhood or community (Document 7).
*   **Surrounding Land Uses/Growth Pressure:** The project considers potential effects on surrounding land uses or growth pressure (Document 7).
*   **Recreational Uses:** The adjacent parkland corridor is actively used for recreational purposes (Document 13).
*   **Tourism:** The document states that there are no existing tourism operations within or adjacent to the project limits, so no impacts are anticipated (Document 6).
*   **Public Consultation:** The project involves public notification and consultation, with a Notice of Intent published (Document 4). Notices were sent to community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities (Document 4).
*   **Impacted Infrastructure:** The project considers the presence of potentially impacted infrastructure located within the tributary and surrounding area (Document 2).

**How the Project Addresses Impacts:**

*   **Class EA Process:** The project is being completed in accordance with the Class Environmental Assessment for Remedial Flood and Erosion Control Projects, amended 2013 (Document 5).  The Class EA planning process requires a full range of alternatives to be developed (Document 16).
*   **Risk Mitigation:**  Risk mitigation is a primary objective of the project (Document 8).
*   **Minimizing Construction Footprint:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible (Document 18).
*   **Timing of Activities:** Construction will occur outside of key migration and breeding windows (Document 18).
*   **Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented (Document 18).
*   **Addressing Drainage:** The selected alternative will address drainage and stormwater runoff (Document 8).
*   **Public Notification and Consultation:** Notices were sent to community groups, homeowners in the vicinity of the Project site, Indigenous communities (Document 4).
*   **Detailed Environmental Analysis:** A detailed environmental analysis of the preferred alternative is conducted, considering various screening criteria (Document 12).

In summary, the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project acknowledges various potential environmental and social impacts and incorporates measures to minimize these impacts through careful planning, adherence to the Class EA process, public consultation, and specific mitigation strategies.
