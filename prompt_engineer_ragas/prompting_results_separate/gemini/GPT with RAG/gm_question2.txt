Based on the provided documents, here are the measures being taken in the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project to ensure the protection and minimal disruption of local wildlife, particularly aquatic species:

*   **Aquatic Habitat Considerations:** Discussions are underway between TRCA, DFO, City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design (Document 7). The project includes considerations for aquatic habitat alteration and loss (Documents 2, 4).

*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Prior to construction, staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated with silt socks to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse (Documents 8, 9).

*   **Minimizing Disturbance:** The protection structures are designed to minimize cutting and disturbing native material, assuming potential contamination (Document 2).

*   **Tree Protection:** Tree protection barriers will be erected where necessary, avoiding grade changes and storage of materials/equipment within the Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) (Document 12).

*   **Site Restoration:** Disturbed areas are to be restored to existing conditions or better, and will be vegetated (Document 12).

*   **Monitoring:** TRCA's Aquatic Monitoring and Management (AMM) Group regularly collects fish population data using electrofishing at monitoring stations near Humber Bay Park East (Document 21). Post-construction monitoring will be conducted to ensure the implemented works are stable and performing as designed (Document 22).

*   **Relocation:** Relocation of bird nesting boxes within the staging area (Document 5).

The baseline inventory identified species such as Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt (Document 1), and Round Goby, Shorthead Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, Spotfin Shiner, and Spottail Shiner (Document 15). The measures above aim to protect the habitats of these and other aquatic species during and after the maintenance project.
