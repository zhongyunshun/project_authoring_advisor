    "answer": "Based on the provided documents, the selection of erosion control structures in the \"Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief\" considers factors beyond just effectiveness. The documents mention the following considerations:\n\n*   **Wave Overtopping and Low Crest Elevation:** The proposed concepts are designed to address leading erosion concerns like low crest elevation and wave overtopping. New material is placed over existing structures where toe and slope stability permits, minimizing excavation.\n*   **Cost and Footprint:** For the cobble/rubble beach (WF11.11), smaller cobble sizes offer a more user-friendly environment but require more material, leading to higher costs, a larger in-water footprint, and greater potential for maintenance.\n*   **Minimizing Excavation and Disturbance:** The design minimizes cutting and disturbing native material, potentially to avoid disturbing contaminated material.\n*   **Environmental Impact**: Erosion and sediment control measures, such as silt socks, are used to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse during construction.\n\nThe documents don't explicitly detail a comparative analysis of different structure *types* based on effectiveness and environmental impact. Instead, they focus on specific design choices (e.g., cobble size) within the chosen structure types and how those choices balance user experience, cost, maintenance, and minimizing environmental disturbance. The choice of using armourstone, cobble beaches, etc., seems to be based on existing conditions and a desire to improve upon them, rather than a ground-up comparison of all possible erosion control methods."
