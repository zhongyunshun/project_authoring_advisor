The documents provide information on how erosion hazard management in German Mills Settlers Park considers potential social impacts:

*   **Public Safety:** Erosion poses a potential safety hazard to park users due to risks to trail infrastructure (Document 1). Safety features like fences might be required (Document 7).
*   **Preserving Public Enjoyment:** Enhancing the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic habitat while preserving public enjoyment of the natural space is a secondary objective (Document 3).
*   **Impact on Park Users:** Potential risks to trail and park users are considered, including impacts on public safety (Document 7).
*   **Social and Cultural Environment:** The project considers benefits and detriments to the social and cultural environment (Document 21).
