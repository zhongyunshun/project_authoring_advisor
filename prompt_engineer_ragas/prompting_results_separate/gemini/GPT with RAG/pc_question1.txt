    "answer": "The documents provide several pieces of information related to the definition and determination of the Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC) within the Peacham Crescent projects:\n\n*   **Definition/Concept:** The LTSSC models the natural regression of a slope crest resulting from erosion forces and is based on the composition and conditions of substrate materials (Document 2).\n*   **Purpose:** The purpose of defining the LTSSC is to determine the area at risk of being undermined and to design slope stabilization work to mitigate risks to human life and property from erosion and slope instability (Documents 6, 15, 17).\n*   **Methodology and Factors:**  The determination of the LTSSC involves geotechnical investigations, including subsurface investigations and borehole drilling, to evaluate the slope (Documents 2, 8, 9). A factor of safety (FoS) is used in the calculation.  Specifically, a FoS of 1.5 was used in the 2015 SS&ERA by Cole Engineering Group Ltd. to delineate the LTSSC behind Peacham Crescent (Document 2). Another document refers to a FoS of 1.3 (Document 3).\n*   **Impact and Application:** The position of the LTSSC is crucial because it can intersect with residential dwellings, indicating a risk (Documents 2, 6). The LTSSC is used to propose and evaluate slope remediation options to protect infrastructure, private property, and human life (Document 8).\n*   **Agencies Involved:**  Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) initiated the Slope Stability & Erosion Risk Assessment (SS&ERA). Cole Engineering Group Ltd. and Soil Engineers Ltd. were retained to complete the assessment (Documents 6, 9, 11).",
