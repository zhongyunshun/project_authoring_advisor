Based on the provided documents, here's what can be gleaned about measures to mitigate impacts on local wildlife in the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project:

*   **Limited Wildlife Impacts:** Document 1 states, "There are no significant wildlife populations identified within the Project limits; therefore, there are no anticipated impacts resulting from the proposed works." This suggests an initial assessment indicated minimal direct impact.

*   **Timing of Construction:** Document 3 mentions that "all construction activities are planned to have the smallest construction footprint as possible and occur outside of key migration and breeding windows when habitat use is not as crucial." This is a key mitigation measure to avoid disturbing sensitive periods for wildlife.

*   **Habitat Restoration:** Document 3 also mentions "A comprehensive restoration plan will..." be implemented. This implies that disturbed areas will be replanted or restored to provide habitat.

*   **Sediment and Erosion Control:** Document 8 highlights the use of "standard sediment control fencing to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse." This protects aquatic habitats from pollution during construction.

*   **Minimal Vegetation Removal:** Document 13 states that vegetation removal will be "minimal and highly selective; therefore, there should be no overall impact to the welfare of vegetation communities within the parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent resulting from the proposed works." This minimizes habitat loss.

*   **Bird Habitat Protection:** Document 18 indicates that the project "will result in only minimal impacts to bird habitat through the removal of select canopy trees. Additionally, construction activities will only occur outside of the bird breeding window."

In summary, the primary mitigation strategies appear to be: minimizing the construction footprint, scheduling work to avoid sensitive wildlife periods (migration and breeding), implementing sediment and erosion control, minimizing vegetation removal, and habitat restoration.
