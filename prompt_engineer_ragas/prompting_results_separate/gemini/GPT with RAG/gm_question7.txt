Okay, I will analyze the provided documents to detail the decision-making process behind choosing specific erosion control structures like armourstone headlands and cobble/rubble beaches, focusing on their effectiveness and environmental impact, based on the provided text.

**Key Considerations in Selecting Erosion Control Structures (Armourstone vs. Cobble/Rubble Beaches):**

The documents highlight several factors influencing the choice of erosion control structures:

*   **Effectiveness (Stability & Protection):**

    *   **Armourstone Headlands/Revetments:** These are often chosen for their stability and ability to withstand strong wave action and prevent erosion. The size of the armour stone is a critical factor, determined by the Hudson equation and design coastal conditions (Documents 1, 2, 6). Larger stones (2-6 tonnes or even larger) are used in areas with high wave energy (Document 4, 5). Rebuilding or supplementing existing armour stone revetments is a common approach (Documents 10, 11). They are used to stabilize shorelines (Document 2) and protect against erosion (Documents 4, 5, 7, 14). The design considers wave overtopping rates (Document 15, 19).
    *   **Cobble/Rubble Beaches:** These are considered for creating a more user-friendly beach environment (Document 3). However, they require more material and have a greater in-water footprint compared to larger stone solutions (Document 3). They can be effective in certain areas, particularly when combined with other structures.

*   **Environmental Impact:**

    *   **Armourstone Headlands/Revetments:** The documents suggest minimizing disturbance during construction to avoid exposing contaminated fill material (Document 6, 22). The placement of armour stone can impact aquatic habitats, so designs may incorporate features like surcharge stone at the toe of revetments to act as aquatic habitat (Document 20).
    *   **Cobble/Rubble Beaches:** The documents mention the potential for greater in-water footprint and maintenance needs with smaller cobble sizes (Document 3).

*   **Cost:**

    *   Smaller cobble sizes, while more user-friendly, can lead to higher costs due to the greater quantity of material required (Document 3). Option 2, supplementing the existing armour stone structures, was chosen due to reduced construction cost and time (Document 22).
    *   Vegetated boulder revetments can be a more cost-efficient means of protection (Document 16, 17).

*   **User Experience/Aesthetics:**

    *   Cobble/rubble beaches are preferred for creating user-friendly environments (Document 3).
    *   Vegetated boulder revetments are a more natural means of protection (Document 16, 17).

*   **Maintenance:**

    *   Smaller cobble treatments may have greater potential for maintenance needs (Document 3).

*   **Existing Conditions & Remediation Goals:**

    *   The conceptual design options are based on assessments of existing conditions (Documents 10, 11).
    *   Remediation approaches include rebuilding revetments or supplementing existing ones (Documents 10, 11).
    *   Where erosion has led to undermining and displacement of existing structures, the focus is on rebuilding and reinforcing these structures (Documents 4, 5, 12, 14).

*   **Regulatory Consultation:**

    *   Decisions regarding remediation options are made in consultation with the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) (Document 22).

**Specific Examples & Decision-Making:**

*   **Humber Bay Park East:** The documents mention the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project. The choice between armourstone headlands and cobble beaches is discussed in the context of creating a balance between shoreline protection and user experience (Documents 3, 8).
*   **Eastern Headland Transition:** The design for this area was updated from a revetment to an embayment/headland structure to preserve fish habitat (Document 20).
*   **Revetment Design:** The selection of armour stone sizes is based on the Hudson equation and design coastal conditions (Documents 1, 2, 6). The design also considers wave overtopping (Documents 15, 19).
*   **Option 2 Selection:** In one instance, supplementing existing armour stone structures (Option 2) was chosen over complete rebuild (Option 1) to reduce disturbance, cost, and time (Document 22).

**In summary, the decision-making process involves a multi-faceted evaluation of effectiveness, environmental impact, cost, user experience, and existing conditions, with input from regulatory bodies like the TRCA. The choice between armourstone headlands/revetments and cobble/rubble beaches depends on the specific site conditions, project goals, and the need to balance shoreline protection with other considerations.**
