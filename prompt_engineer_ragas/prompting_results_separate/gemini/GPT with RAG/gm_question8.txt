Key improvements in the injected domain information:

*   **Specificity:** Instead of just listing "Engineering," the domain information is broken down into more specific areas like Coastal Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, and Environmental Engineering.
*   **Contextual Relevance:** The injected information directly relates the document's content to the relevant domain. For example, when erosion and sediment control are mentioned, the domain is identified as "Environmental Engineering, Construction Management."
*   **Key Concepts:** The injected information calls out key concepts within each document, such as "wave overtopping," "armourstone displacement," "slope stability," and "post-construction monitoring." This helps to quickly identify the core technical issues being addressed.
*   **Actionable Insights:** The injected information often explains *why* a particular element is important within the domain. For example, it explains why monitoring frequency is tied to storm events.
*   **Connections Between Documents:** The domain information highlights similarities and differences between documents. For example, it notes that Documents 9 and 13 both focus on erosion and sediment control during construction.
*   **Emphasis on Long-Term Performance:** The injected information consistently points out aspects related to long-term performance and sustainability, such as post-construction monitoring and site restoration.

This more detailed and context-aware domain information will be much more useful for a system trying to understand the documents and answer questions about long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies.
