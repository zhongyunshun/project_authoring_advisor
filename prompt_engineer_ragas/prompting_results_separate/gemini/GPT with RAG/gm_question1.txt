Based on the provided documents, a comprehensive explanation of the "Slope Stability Analysis" methodology within the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, and its impact on project decisions, can be constructed as follows:

**Methodology of Slope Stability Analysis:**

While a detailed breakdown of the slope stability analysis methodology is not explicitly provided in these documents, we can infer aspects of it from mentions of related concepts and documents:

1.  **Assessment and Studies:** The documents mention "studies and assessments undertaken by TRCA to evaluate the Project site" (Document 2). These assessments likely included geotechnical investigations, geological surveys, and hydrological analyses to understand the soil properties, groundwater conditions, and existing slope conditions.

2.  **Erosion Risk Assessment:** Cole Engineering conducted a "SLOPE STABILITY & EROSION RISK ASSESSMENT" (Document 1, Document 16). This suggests a combined approach, considering both slope stability and erosion potential.

3.  **Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC):** The concept of a "projected long-term stable slope crest (LTSSC)" is mentioned (Documents 4, 10). This indicates that the analysis aimed to determine the stable position of the slope crest over time, considering factors like soil creep, erosion, and groundwater fluctuations. Figure 7 in document 10 shows the LTSSC projected behind Peacham Crescent, with a factor of safety of 1.5.

4.  **Factor of Safety:** The mention of a "factor of safety of 1.5" (Document 10) is a standard geotechnical engineering practice. The factor of safety is the ratio of resisting forces to driving forces on a slope. A factor of safety greater than 1.0 indicates a stable slope, while values closer to 1.0 or below suggest instability. A factor of safety of 1.5 is a common target for slope stabilization projects.

5.  **Historical Analysis:** Historical aerial photographs were used in the analysis (Documents 15, 20, 21, 22). These photographs (from 1946, 1952, and 1967) provide insights into the historical changes in the slope, erosion patterns, and land use, which are crucial for understanding the long-term stability trends.

6.  **Remediation Design:** The "Detailed Design Brief (Terraprobe, 2020)" (Document 1, 12) contains a "Remediation Design" section, which would be informed by the slope stability analysis. This suggests that the analysis results directly influenced the design of the stabilization measures.

**Impact on Project Decisions:**

The slope stability analysis directly influenced several key project decisions:

1.  **Justification for the Project:** The analysis provided the justification for TRCA's involvement by demonstrating the extent of erosion and slope instability hazards impacting the site (Document 2). The analysis identified the risk to human life and property, leading to the decision to implement the stabilization project (Document 7).

2.  **Selection of Remedial Solutions:** The analysis helped in developing and evaluating different remedial solutions. The chosen alternative had to provide long-term, low-maintenance protection (Document 7). The analysis also informed the assessment of potential impacts on the environment (Document 6, 13).

3.  **Design of Stabilization Measures:** The analysis results directly informed the design of the slope stabilization measures, such as the use of gabion basket erosion control structures (Document 17) and potentially MSE (Mechanically Stabilized Earth) structures (Document 13). The design aimed to achieve a target factor of safety for long-term stability (Document 10).

4.  **Consideration of Public Safety:** The analysis considered the presence of a public footpath at the base of the slope and the potential impact on public safety (Document 4, 8). The project included safety features like safety fences to mitigate risks to the public.

5.  **Drainage and Stormwater Management:** The analysis helped identify drainage and stormwater runoff concerns within the project limits (Document 9). The selected alternative addressed these concerns to improve slope stability.

In summary, the "Slope Stability Analysis" for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project was a critical component, involving geotechnical investigations, historical analysis, and the calculation of safety factors. It directly influenced the justification, design, and implementation of the project, ensuring the long-term stability of the slope and the safety of the surrounding area.
