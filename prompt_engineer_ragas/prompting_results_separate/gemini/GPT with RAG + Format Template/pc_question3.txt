Query: #### Can you detail any strategies outlined in the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" to promote sustainable development and conservation throughout the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project? ####
Answer: "The '2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief' outlines several strategies relevant to sustainable development and conservation within the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project. These include erosion and sediment control measures to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse during construction (Document 12, page 15). The document also mentions the isolation of the Work Area with standard sediment control fencing, which will be inspected and maintained throughout construction until the site is stabilized (Document 12, page 15). Additionally, there's a reference to required tree removals and hazardous plants screening, indicating an awareness of ecological impacts (Document 13, page 3)."
