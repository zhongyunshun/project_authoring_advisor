Query: #### How does the slope stabilization project on Peacham Crescent plan to address potential social impacts and ensure the safety of the local community ####
Answer: "The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project addresses potential social impacts and ensures public safety through several measures:

1.  **Public Safety:** The project considers the potential risks to public safety along the trail and slope, including the requirement for safety features such as safety fences (Document 3).
2.  **Pedestrian Traffic:** During construction, pedestrian traffic will be temporarily restricted along the paved pathway that runs through the parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent (Document 9).
3.  **Public Notifications and Consultation:** Public contact occurred through the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018. Notices were sent to community groups and homeowners in the vicinity of the project site (Document 18).
4.  **Risk Mitigation:** The primary objective of the project is risk mitigation to protect human life and property from erosion and slope instability (Document 4, Document 5, Document 21).
