Query: #### What are the key considerations for aquatic habitat alteration and loss in the Humber Bay Park East maintenance projects? ####
Answer: "Key considerations for aquatic habitat alteration and loss in the Humber Bay Park East maintenance projects involve evaluating the effect of proposed structures on aquatic habitat in plan view to calculate the areas of fish habitat that would be altered or lost as a result of construction (Design Brief - Phase II_DRAFT.pdf, page 25). The protection structures were designed to minimize cutting and disturbing of native material (Design Brief - Phase II_DRAFT.pdf, page 22). Discussions are underway between TRCA, DFO, City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 30)."
