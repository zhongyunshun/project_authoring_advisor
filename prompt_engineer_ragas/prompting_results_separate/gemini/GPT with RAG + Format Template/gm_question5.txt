Answer: "Yes, both the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project and the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project are discussed in terms of phasing and potential future work.

*   **Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project**: This project is explicitly divided into three phases due to the extent of the project area and the multi-year nature of construction (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 4; HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 4).

*   **Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project**: While the documents detail the existing project plan, they do not explicitly mention future phases or expansions. The focus is on the current project limits and immediate surroundings (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf).

To provide more specific information about future phases or expansions, it would be helpful to know if you're interested in specific aspects such as timelines, ecological restoration plans, or particular areas within the project limits."
