#### Can you explain the methodology used for the "Slope Stability Analysis" detailed in the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project, and how it impacts project decisions? ####
The documents mention "Slope Stability & Erosion Risk Assessment" by Cole Engineering (2015) as a reference for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project (Document 1, Document 16). Document 10 refers to a "long-term stable slope crest (LTSSC)" projected behind Peacham Crescent with a factor of safety of 1.5, based on work by Cole Engineering Group Ltd. in 2015.

To provide a detailed explanation of the methodology used for the slope stability analysis and its impact on project decisions, could you please specify which aspects you are most interested in? For example:

*   The specific software or models used in the analysis.
*   The parameters considered in the analysis (e.g., soil properties, groundwater levels, surcharge loads).
*   How the results of the analysis were used to determine the location of the long-term stable slope crest (LTSSC).
*   How the analysis informed the selection of the preferred stabilization alternative (e.g., MSE structure).
*   How the factor of safety of 1.5 was determined and its significance.
