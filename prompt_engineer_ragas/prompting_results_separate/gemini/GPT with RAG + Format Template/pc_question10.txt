Okay, I can provide information on how the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity, specifically regarding bat species and butternut trees.

Based on the provided documents:

*   **Butternut Trees:** A Category 2 butternut tree has been identified within the project area, located along the proposed access route (Document 1, page 11). The document also mentions that a butternut tree was identified within the limits of the proposed construction access route to the Project site and that butternut populations have been impacted by butternut canker (Document 19, page 26). Furthermore, genetic testing determined that the butternut within the construction access route is genetically pure and therefore highly susceptible to butternut canker (Document 2, page 27).

*   **Bat Species:** Bat habitat is present within the project, and appropriate compensation will be coordinated by TRCAâ€™s ERM Project staff in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol (Document 8, page 10).

To provide a more comprehensive response, could you please clarify what specific aspects of the impacts on biodiversity you are most interested in? For example:

*   Are you interested in the specific mitigation strategies for butternut trees and bat species?
*   Are you interested in any monitoring plans related to these species?
*   Are you interested in any compensation plans for the impacted species?
