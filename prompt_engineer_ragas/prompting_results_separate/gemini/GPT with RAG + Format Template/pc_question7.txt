Query: #### Based on the provided documents, what were the alternative solutions considered for addressing erosion and slope instability behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent? ####
Answer: The documents mention several alternative solutions considered for addressing the erosion and slope instability behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent. These include:

*   **Do Nothing Alternative:** This involves monitoring the site without taking any active measures to stabilize the slope (Document 1, 17, 19, 22).
*   **MSE Structure (Mechanically Stabilized Earth):** This was identified as the preferred alternative in one document (Document 3, 8, 11).
*   Other conceptual alternative solutions were developed by Terraprobe Inc. (2019) as part of the Class EA process (Document 1, 2, 10). Soil Engineers Ltd. also provided five potential alternatives that were assessed based on feasibility, constructability, and cost (Document 17, 19, 22).

To provide a more detailed list of the alternatives and the specific criteria used for their evaluation, it would be helpful to know what aspects of the alternatives are of interest. For example, are you interested in the environmental impacts, the costs, or the technical feasibility of each alternative?
