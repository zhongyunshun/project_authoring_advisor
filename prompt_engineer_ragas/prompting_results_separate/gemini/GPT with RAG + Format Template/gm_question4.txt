Okay, I can provide information on the roles of stakeholders in the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project. To give you the most accurate and complete answer, could you please clarify what aspects of "project success" you're most interested in? For example, are you interested in:

*   **Specific responsibilities:** What are each stakeholder's defined duties?
*   **Decision-making processes:** How do stakeholders collaborate to make decisions?
*   **Conflict resolution:** How are disagreements between stakeholders addressed?
*   **Oversight and accountability:** How is each stakeholder held accountable for their role?
*   **Financial contributions:** What are the financial commitments of each stakeholder?

Once I understand what you're looking for, I can provide a more tailored and helpful response based on the available documents.
