Okay, I understand. I will analyze the provided documents regarding the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, focusing on tree removals, restoration plantings, and their impacts on biodiversity, especially concerning species at risk like bats and butternut trees.

To provide a comprehensive answer, could you clarify a few points?

1.  **Specifics on "specified tree removals":** Are you interested in the *number* of trees being removed, the *types* of trees, the *reasons* for removal (e.g., construction access, diseased trees), or all of the above? Knowing this will help me focus on the most relevant information.
2.  **Details on "restoration plantings":** What aspects of the restoration plantings are most relevant to your query? Are you interested in the *types* of species being planted, the *purpose* of the plantings (e.g., soil stabilization, habitat creation), the *location* of the plantings, or the *monitoring* of their success?
3.  **Focus on bats and butternut trees:** Are you primarily concerned with the *direct* impacts on these species (e.g., removal of roosting habitat for bats, removal of butternut trees) or the *indirect* impacts through habitat alteration or changes in the overall ecosystem?
4.  **Temporal scope:** Are you interested in the *short-term* impacts during and immediately after construction, the *long-term* impacts as the restoration plantings mature, or both?

Once I have this clarification, I can provide a more targeted and useful response, drawing from the provided documents.
