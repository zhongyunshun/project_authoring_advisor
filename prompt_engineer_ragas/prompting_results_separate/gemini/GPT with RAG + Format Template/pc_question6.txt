#### What are the anticipated environmental and social impacts of the slope stabilization project, and how does the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP" propose to address these impacts? ####
The Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, as documented in the "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP," identifies and addresses potential environmental and social impacts. Here's a breakdown:

**Potential Environmental Impacts:**

*   **Wildlife Habitat:** The project considers potential effects on wildlife habitat. (Document 1)
*   **Habitat Linkages or Corridors:** It also assesses impacts on habitat linkages or corridors. (Document 1)
*   **Vegetation Communities:** The project evaluates potential effects on significant vegetation communities. (Document 1)
*   **Wetlands:**  The project acknowledges the presence of wetland vegetation communities along the southern limits of the project area. (Document 9)
*   **Existing Natural Habitat:** Construction activities are planned to minimize the construction footprint and occur outside key migration and breeding windows. A comprehensive restoration plan will also be implemented. (Document 18)
*   **Unique Landforms:** The document states that there are no known unique landforms within or adjacent to the project limits, so no impacts are expected. (Document 10, 12)

**Potential Social Impacts:**

*   **Impact to Public Safety:** The project considers potential risks to public safety, especially along trails and the slope, and evaluates the need for safety features like fences. (Document 11)
*   **Surrounding Neighborhood or Community:** The project considers the impact on the surrounding neighborhood or community. (Document 7)
*   **Surrounding Land Uses or Growth Pressure:**  The project considers the impact on surrounding land uses or growth pressure. (Document 7)
*   **Existing Infrastructure:** The project assesses potential impacts to existing infrastructure. (Document 7)
*   **Recreational Uses:** The adjacent parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent is actively used for recreational purposes. (Document 13)
*   **Property Accessibility:** The project considers access route options to the slope behind specific properties. (Document 6)
*   **Tourism:** The document indicates that there are no existing tourism operations within or adjacent to the project limits. (Document 6)

**Proposed Measures to Address Impacts:**

*   **Minimizing Construction Footprint:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest possible footprint. (Document 18)
*   **Timing of Activities:** Construction will occur outside of key migration and breeding windows. (Document 18)
*   **Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented. (Document 18)
*   **Public Consultation:** Public notification and consultation occurred, starting with a Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018. Notices were sent to community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities. (Document 4)

**Overall Objective:**

*   The project aims to provide long-term, low-maintenance protection for private properties from valley slope erosion. (Document 3)
*   The project is being completed in accordance with the Class Environmental Assessment for Remedial Flood and Erosion Control Projects, with the objective of reducing risk to life and property. (Document 5)
