Okay, I understand. I will analyze the provided documents and respond to the query about the selection of erosion control structures in the "Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief," focusing on effectiveness and environmental impact.

Before I provide a response, could you clarify which specific aspects of "effectiveness and environmental impact" you're most interested in? For example, are you concerned with:

*   Specific metrics used to measure effectiveness (e.g., reduction in erosion rate, wave overtopping)?
*   Particular environmental impacts that were considered (e.g., habitat disturbance, water quality)?
*   A comparison of different erosion control structure types in terms of these factors?

Knowing this will help me narrow my search and provide a more relevant and focused answer from the provided documents.
