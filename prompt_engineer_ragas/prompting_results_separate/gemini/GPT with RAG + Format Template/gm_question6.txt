Okay, I understand. I will use the provided documents to answer the query, focusing on erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park and how it addresses potential social impacts. I will cite the source documents whenever possible.

Here's my response to the query:

#### How does the erosion hazard management in areas like German Mills Settlers Park plan to address potential social impacts, such as access to parklands and community recreational spaces? ####

The documents related to the German Mills Settlers Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project address potential social impacts related to park access and recreational spaces in the following ways:

*   **Public Safety and Trail Usage:** Erosion along German Mills Creek poses a potential safety hazard to park users and risks to trail infrastructure. Mitigation involves considering safety features like safety fences (Document 1, 7).

*   **Preservation of Public Enjoyment:** The project aims to enhance the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic habitat of German Mills Park while preserving public enjoyment of the natural space (Document 3).

*   **Impacts During Construction:** Erosion and sediment control measures, such as sediment control fencing, are implemented prior to construction to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse. These barriers are maintained throughout the construction period (Document 6).

*   **Long-Term Solutions:** The scope of work includes providing long-term solutions for the protection of regional sanitary infrastructure, City stormwater, and trail infrastructure. This also includes opportunities to provide aquatic and terrestrial habitat improvements through site restoration (Document 18).

*   **Consideration of Alternatives:** Design alternatives are evaluated considering potential impacts on various factors, including the social and cultural environment (Document 7, 21).

In summary, the erosion hazard management plans for German Mills Settlers Park aim to balance infrastructure protection with the preservation of recreational spaces and public safety. Measures are put in place to minimize disruption during construction and to enhance the park's natural environment for continued public enjoyment.
