The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II" focuses specifically on Phase II. Therefore, it would *not* contain information about future phases *beyond* Phase II. The document would only detail the plans for the current phase under development.

To find information on future phases or expansions beyond Phase II, you would need to consult separate planning documents, park master plans, city council reports, or public consultation materials that specifically address the long-term vision for Humber Bay Park East.
