Unfortunately, without access to the specific "Slope Stability and Erosion Risk Assessment" document for the Peacham Crescent projects, I can only provide a *general* definition and criteria for Long-Term Stable Slope Crests (LTSSC) based on common geotechnical engineering and erosion control practices.

**General Definition of Long-Term Stable Slope Crests (LTSSC):**

A Long-Term Stable Slope Crest is a section of a slope's upper edge (crest) that is expected to remain stable and resistant to erosion over an extended period, typically decades or even centuries.  "Stable" in this context means that the crest is unlikely to experience significant failures (e.g., landslides, slumps, toppling) or excessive erosion that would compromise the integrity of the slope below or impact infrastructure or property located near the crest.  The "long-term" aspect emphasizes that the stability considers potential changes in environmental conditions, such as climate change impacts (increased precipitation, freeze-thaw cycles), vegetation changes, and potential seismic activity.

**General Criteria Used to Determine LTSSC:**

The criteria for determining a LTSSC typically involve a combination of field investigations, laboratory testing, and engineering analysis.  Key factors include:

*   **Geological and Geotechnical Properties:**
    *   **Soil Type and Strength:** High strength soils (e.g., well-graded gravels, dense sands, stiff clays) are generally more resistant to erosion and failure than weak soils (e.g., silts, loose sands, soft clays).  Shear strength parameters (cohesion and friction angle) are critical.
    *   **Soil Density and Compaction:** Denser, more compacted soils are generally more stable.
    *   **Bedrock Geology:** The presence, depth, and characteristics of bedrock underlying the slope significantly influence stability.  Fractured or weathered bedrock can be a weakness.
    *   **Groundwater Conditions:** The level and flow of groundwater can significantly impact slope stability. High groundwater levels reduce soil strength and increase pore water pressure, leading to instability.  Seepage at the crest is a strong indicator of potential problems.
    *   **Previous Slope Failures:** Evidence of past landslides, slumps, or other slope failures in the area is a strong indicator of potential instability.
*   **Slope Geometry:**
    *   **Slope Angle:** Steeper slopes are inherently less stable than gentler slopes.
    *   **Slope Height:** Taller slopes are generally more susceptible to failure.
    *   **Slope Morphology:** Irregularities in the slope face (e.g., benches, terraces) can influence stability.
*   **Hydrological Conditions:**
    *   **Rainfall Intensity and Duration:** High-intensity rainfall events can saturate soils and trigger slope failures.
    *   **Surface Water Runoff:** Concentrated surface water runoff can erode the slope crest and contribute to instability.
    *   **Drainage Patterns:** Proper drainage is essential for maintaining slope stability.
*   **Vegetation Cover:**
    *   **Type and Density of Vegetation:** Deep-rooted vegetation can stabilize slopes by binding the soil together and reducing erosion.  The type of vegetation is important, as some species are more effective than others.
    *   **Root Depth and Distribution:**  The depth and distribution of roots are critical for soil reinforcement.
    *   **Vegetation Management:**  Proper vegetation management is essential for maintaining slope stability.
*   **Erosion Potential:**
    *   **Soil Erodibility:** Some soils are more easily eroded than others.  Factors such as soil texture, organic matter content, and slope angle influence erodibility.
    *   **Wind Erosion:** In exposed areas, wind erosion can contribute to slope instability.
    *   **Freeze-Thaw Cycles:** Freeze-thaw cycles can weaken soils and make them more susceptible to erosion.
*   **Human Activities:**
    *   **Excavation and Fill:** Excavation at the toe of a slope or placement of fill at the crest can significantly impact stability.
    *   **Construction Activities:** Construction activities can damage vegetation and disrupt drainage patterns, leading to slope instability.
    *   **Land Use:** Land use practices, such as agriculture and deforestation, can impact slope stability.
*   **Analysis Methods:**
    *   **Limit Equilibrium Analysis:**  Commonly used to calculate the factor of safety against slope failure.
    *   **Finite Element Analysis:**  More sophisticated method that can model complex soil behavior and groundwater flow.
    *   **Empirical Methods:**  Based on historical data and observations of slope performance.

**Specific Criteria for Peacham Crescent Projects (Unknowable without the Document):**

To determine the *specific* criteria used in the Peacham Crescent projects' assessment, you would need to consult the actual document.  Look for sections that:

*   Define "Long-Term Stable Slope Crest" or similar terms.
*   Specify the factors of safety used for slope stability analysis.
*   Describe the methods used to assess slope stability and erosion risk.
*   Detail the site-specific geological and geotechnical conditions.
*   Outline any mitigation measures required to ensure long-term stability.

**In Summary:**

While I can provide a general framework, the definitive answer to your question lies within the "Slope Stability and Erosion Risk Assessment" document specific to the Peacham Crescent projects. You will need to access and carefully review that document to understand the specific definition and criteria used.
