Based on the prompt, I need to infer the content of the Ecology Survey Memorandum for the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project to answer the question. Since I don't have access to that document, I will provide a **hypothetical answer** that reflects common mitigation measures used in similar projects. This answer assumes the survey identified common species and potential habitat concerns.

Here's a hypothetical response:

"Based on the findings of the Ecology Survey Memorandum, the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project proposes the following specific measures to mitigate impacts on local wildlife, particularly concerning species identified in the vicinity:

*   **Pre-Construction Surveys and Monitoring:** Before any ground-disturbing activities, qualified biologists will conduct pre-construction surveys to identify and relocate any sensitive species or nests within the project area. Ongoing monitoring will continue throughout the construction phase to ensure mitigation measures are effective and to address any unforeseen impacts.

*   **Timing Restrictions:** Work will be scheduled to avoid critical breeding and nesting seasons for identified bird species (e.g., avoiding construction during peak nesting periods in spring and early summer). These timing restrictions will be enforced based on species-specific breeding calendars relevant to the Peacham Crescent area.

*   **Habitat Restoration and Enhancement:** Disturbed areas will be restored using native plant species that provide food and cover for local wildlife. This includes planting trees and shrubs that are known to be beneficial to identified species, such as [mention specific species if the survey identified key food sources or habitat preferences, e.g., planting berry-producing shrubs for songbirds or installing snags for cavity-nesting birds]. We will also explore opportunities to enhance existing habitat adjacent to the project area.

*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Strict erosion and sediment control measures, such as silt fences, hay bales, and sediment basins, will be implemented to prevent sediment runoff into nearby waterways. This will protect aquatic habitats and water quality, which are critical for the health of aquatic species like [mention specific aquatic species if identified, e.g., trout or amphibians].

*   **Wildlife Exclusion Fencing:** Temporary wildlife exclusion fencing will be installed around the construction zone to prevent wildlife from entering the area and potentially being harmed by construction activities. This fencing will be checked regularly and maintained throughout the project duration.

*   **Noise Reduction Measures:** Where feasible, noise reduction measures, such as using quieter equipment and implementing noise barriers, will be employed to minimize disturbance to wildlife, especially during sensitive periods.

*   **Invasive Species Control:** The project will include measures to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive plant species. This will help to maintain the integrity of existing habitats and prevent the displacement of native plants that are important for wildlife.

*   **Post-Construction Monitoring:** Post-construction monitoring will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the mitigation measures and to identify any areas where further restoration or enhancement is needed. This monitoring will include assessing the success of revegetation efforts and the return of wildlife to the restored areas.

These measures are designed to minimize the project's impact on local wildlife and to ensure that the Peacham Crescent area continues to provide valuable habitat for a variety of species."

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Specific Species:** This answer assumes that the Ecology Survey identified specific species of concern. The mitigation measures would need to be tailored to the specific needs of those species.
*   **Regulatory Requirements:** The project must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations regarding wildlife protection.
*   **Adaptive Management:** The mitigation plan should be adaptive, allowing for adjustments based on monitoring results and new information.

This answer is hypothetical and should be replaced with information from the actual Ecology Survey Memorandum.
