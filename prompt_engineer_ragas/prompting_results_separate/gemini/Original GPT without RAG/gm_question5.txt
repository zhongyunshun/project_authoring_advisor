I do not have access to real-time information, including specific project plans for Humber Bay Park East and Peacham Crescent. Therefore, I cannot tell you if there are future phases or expansions planned for erosion control and slope stabilization efforts in those projects.

To find this information, you would need to:

*   **Contact the relevant municipal or regional government department:** This is the most likely source of information. Look for departments related to parks, conservation, or public works in the area where the projects are located.
*   **Search the project websites or documentation:** If these projects have dedicated websites or publicly available documentation, those resources might contain information about future plans.
*   **Contact the project developers or contractors:** If you know who is responsible for the project's execution, you could try contacting them directly.
*   **Attend public meetings or consultations:** Sometimes, information about future phases of projects is shared at public meetings.
