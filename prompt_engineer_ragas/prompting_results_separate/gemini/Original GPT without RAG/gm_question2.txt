####To determine the specific measures being taken to protect wildlife during the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, you would need to consult official project documentation, environmental impact assessments, permits, and communications from the City of Toronto (or the relevant managing authority). Here's a breakdown of the types of measures likely to be implemented, and how you might find them:

**Likely Measures (General Examples Based on Typical Practices):**

*   **Pre-Construction Surveys and Mitigation Planning:**
    *   *Detailed Baseline Inventory Review:* The project team would have reviewed the existing baseline inventory (which you've mentioned) to understand the specific species present, their habitats, and sensitivities.
    *   *Pre-Construction Surveys:* Before any work begins, qualified biologists would likely conduct additional surveys to confirm the presence and location of sensitive species (e.g., fish spawning areas, bird nesting sites, amphibian habitats). This helps to refine mitigation strategies.
    *   *Mitigation Plans:* Based on the surveys, a detailed mitigation plan would be developed outlining specific actions to avoid or minimize impacts. This plan is often legally required and subject to regulatory approval.

*   **Habitat Protection and Avoidance:**
    *   *Work Zone Delineation:* Clearly marking work zones to prevent encroachment into sensitive habitat areas.
    *   *Timing Restrictions:* Avoiding construction activities during critical periods for wildlife, such as fish spawning seasons, bird nesting periods, or amphibian breeding times.
    *   *Habitat Buffers:* Establishing buffer zones between construction activities and sensitive habitats.

*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:**
    *   *Silt Fences and Sediment Barriers:* Installing barriers to prevent sediment runoff from entering the water and harming aquatic life.
    *   *Erosion Control Blankets and Matting:* Using materials to stabilize soil and prevent erosion on disturbed areas.
    *   *Stormwater Management:* Implementing measures to manage stormwater runoff and prevent pollutants from entering the lake.

*   **Water Quality Monitoring:**
    *   *Regular Monitoring:* Monitoring water quality parameters (e.g., turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen) before, during, and after construction to ensure that water quality standards are met.
    *   *Corrective Actions:* Having protocols in place to take immediate corrective actions if water quality thresholds are exceeded.

*   **Fish Protection:**
    *   *Fish Relocation:* If necessary, relocating fish from the work area to suitable habitat. This is often done by qualified professionals using specialized techniques.
    *   *Fish Salvage:* Implementing fish salvage operations during dewatering activities or other situations where fish may be trapped.
    *   *Isolation Techniques:* Use of barriers or other techniques to isolate work areas from the main body of water to prevent fish from entering the construction zone.

*   **Noise and Vibration Control:**
    *   *Noise Barriers:* Using noise barriers to reduce noise levels that could disturb wildlife.
    *   *Vibration Monitoring:* Monitoring vibration levels to ensure they do not exceed acceptable limits.
    *   *Equipment Selection:* Using quieter equipment and construction methods whenever possible.

*   **Pollution Prevention:**
    *   *Spill Prevention and Response Plans:* Having plans in place to prevent and respond to spills of fuel, oil, or other hazardous materials.
    *   *Proper Waste Management:* Implementing proper waste management practices to prevent pollution.
    *   *Equipment Maintenance:* Regularly maintaining equipment to prevent leaks and spills.

*   **Post-Construction Restoration:**
    *   *Habitat Restoration:* Restoring any disturbed habitat areas to their pre-construction condition or better. This may involve planting native vegetation, creating artificial reefs, or other habitat enhancements.
    *   *Monitoring and Adaptive Management:* Monitoring the effectiveness of mitigation measures and adapting them as needed based on the results.

**How to Find Specific Information for the Humber Bay Park East Project:**

1.  **City of Toronto Website:** Start by searching the City of Toronto website for the "Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project." Look for project pages, environmental assessments, public notices, and contact information for the project team.
2.  **Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO):** Check the ERO for notices related to the project. The ERO is a public registry where the Ontario government posts information about environmental matters, including environmental assessments and permits.
3.  **Project Documents:** Look for the project's environmental impact assessment (EIA) or environmental assessment report (EAR). These documents typically contain detailed information about the project's potential impacts on wildlife and the mitigation measures that will be implemented.
4.  **Permits and Approvals:** Check for permits and approvals issued by regulatory agencies, such as the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) or Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO). These permits often contain specific conditions related to wildlife protection.
5.  **Contact the Project Team:** If you cannot find the information you need online, contact the project team directly. The City of Toronto's website should provide contact information for the project manager or other relevant personnel.
6.  **Public Consultations:** Review records of any public consultations or meetings that were held for the project. These records may contain information about wildlife protection measures.

By following these steps, you should be able to find specific information about the measures being taken to protect wildlife during the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project. Remember to look for official documentation and communications to ensure the accuracy of the information.
