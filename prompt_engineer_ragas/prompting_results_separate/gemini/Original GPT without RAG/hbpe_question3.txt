#### The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project likely incorporates several sustainable development practices to ensure long-term environmental conservation. While specific details require access to project documentation (Environmental Impact Assessments, project plans, etc.), here are some common practices that would be relevant and likely considered:

*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Implementing robust erosion and sediment control measures is crucial to prevent soil runoff into Lake Ontario. This could include silt fences, sediment traps, temporary vegetation cover, and stabilized construction entrances. Minimizing exposed soil areas and rapidly re-vegetating disturbed areas are key.

*   **Habitat Restoration and Enhancement:** The project likely includes plans to restore and enhance existing habitats impacted by the maintenance work. This could involve re-planting native vegetation species, creating or improving wetland areas, and providing habitat features for wildlife (e.g., birdhouses, bat boxes, fish spawning areas). Focus on native species adapted to the local environment.

*   **Water Quality Management:** Protecting water quality in Lake Ontario is paramount. This involves measures to prevent pollution from construction activities, such as proper storage and handling of materials, spill prevention and response plans, and treatment of stormwater runoff.

*   **Waste Management and Recycling:** Implementing a comprehensive waste management plan to minimize waste generation and maximize recycling of construction materials. This could include separating recyclable materials (concrete, asphalt, metal, wood) and using recycled materials in the project where feasible.

*   **Sustainable Materials Selection:** Choosing sustainable construction materials with low embodied energy, recycled content, and minimal environmental impact. This could involve using locally sourced materials to reduce transportation emissions.

*   **Noise and Air Quality Mitigation:** Implementing measures to minimize noise and air pollution during construction. This could involve using quieter equipment, controlling dust emissions (e.g., watering down construction areas), and limiting construction hours.

*   **Energy Efficiency:** Utilizing energy-efficient equipment and practices during construction to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

*   **Protection of Wildlife:** Implementing measures to protect wildlife during construction, such as avoiding disturbance of sensitive areas, conducting pre-construction surveys for wildlife, and implementing buffer zones around nesting areas.

*   **Long-Term Monitoring:** Establishing a long-term monitoring program to assess the effectiveness of the sustainable development practices and to identify any unforeseen environmental impacts.

*   **Community Engagement:** Engaging with the local community to gather input on the project and to address any concerns related to environmental impacts.

**To get specific details, you would need to:**

*   **Consult the City of Toronto's website:** Look for information related to the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, including project plans, Environmental Impact Assessments, and public consultation documents.
*   **Contact the City of Toronto Parks, Forestry & Recreation Department:** They would be the best source of information about the specific sustainable development practices being implemented in the project.
*   **Review publicly available environmental reports:** Search for any environmental reports or studies related to the project that may have been conducted.

Without these resources, the above points are based on common best practices for similar projects.
