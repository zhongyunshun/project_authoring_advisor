I am sorry, but I do not have access to the internet or specific files like the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief." Therefore, I cannot provide you with the long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies recommended in that document.

To find this information, you will need to:

1.  **Locate the document:** If you have the document, review the sections related to long-term monitoring, maintenance, or slope stability.
2.  **Contact the project stakeholders:** Reach out to the project engineers, contractors, or the relevant authorities involved in the Peacham Cres project. They should have access to the project brief and be able to provide the information you need.
