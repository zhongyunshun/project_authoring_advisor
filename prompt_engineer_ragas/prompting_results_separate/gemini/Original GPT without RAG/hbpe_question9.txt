This question is too broad to answer without specific context. To answer it effectively, I need more information about:

*   **Which projects are you referring to?** (e.g., a specific development project, a research project, a government initiative, etc.)
*   **What geographical location are you interested in?** (e.g., a specific region, country, or even a specific Indigenous community)
*   **What is the timeframe you are interested in?** (e.g., the last year, the last five years, since a certain date, etc.)

Once you provide this context, I can help you find relevant information through:

*   **Searching online databases and repositories:** This includes academic databases, government websites, and organizational reports.
*   **Searching news articles and media reports:** This can provide information on public consultations and community engagement.
*   **Searching organizational websites:** Many organizations involved in projects with Indigenous communities have information on their consultation processes on their websites.

Without knowing the specific projects, location, and timeframe, I can only provide general information about the importance of Indigenous consultation.
