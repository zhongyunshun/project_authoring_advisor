I lack the ability to access external files or specific documents online, including the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief." Therefore, I cannot tell you how that document addresses potential impacts on biodiversity, bat species, or butternut trees.

To find that information, you would need to:

1.  **Access the document:** Locate the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief."
2.  **Search the document:** Use keywords like "biodiversity," "bats," "butternut," "environment," "impact," "conservation," "mitigation," "species at risk," and "wildlife" to find relevant sections.
3.  **Read the relevant sections carefully:** Analyze the document's discussion of potential impacts and proposed mitigation measures related to biodiversity, bats, and butternut trees.

If you can provide the text of the relevant sections of the document, I can help you analyze them.
