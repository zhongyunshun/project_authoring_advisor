I need the "Design Brief - Phase II" document to answer this question. I don't have access to external files or the internet to retrieve this document.

To answer your question effectively, I would need the text of the document. Once you provide the text, I can analyze it for the following:

*   **Specific Engineering Challenges:** Look for mentions of problems or difficulties encountered during the design process. These might include:
    *   Wave action and erosion
    *   Ice loading
    *   Soil stability
    *   Material selection for durability and environmental impact
    *   Construction feasibility in the existing environment
    *   Integration with existing park infrastructure
    *   Meeting regulatory requirements (e.g., environmental permits)
    *   Cost constraints

*   **Specific Engineering Considerations:** Look for mentions of factors that were taken into account during the design process. These might include:
    *   Wave climate analysis (wave height, frequency, direction)
    *   Water level fluctuations (seasonal, storm surges)
    *   Ice formation and movement patterns
    *   Geotechnical investigations (soil properties, bearing capacity)
    *   Hydraulic modeling
    *   Environmental impact assessment
    *   Aesthetics and visual impact
    *   Public access and safety
    *   Long-term maintenance requirements
    *   Climate change impacts (sea level rise, increased storm frequency)
    *   Different shoreline protection methods (e.g., riprap, seawalls, breakwaters, living shorelines) and their suitability.

**Without the document, I can only provide a general list of potential challenges and considerations. Please provide the text of the document for a more specific and accurate answer.**
