To accurately answer your question, I need access to the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief". I cannot access external files or specific documents online.

However, I can give you a general approach to finding this information *if you have access to the document*:

1. **Search for keywords:** Look for terms like "future phases," "subsequent stages," "follow-up," "next steps," "long-term," "future work," "additional stabilization," "phase 2," "recommendations," "further investigation," "monitoring," etc.
2. **Review the "Recommendations" or "Conclusion" sections:** These sections often outline potential future actions.
3. **Examine the "Scope" section:** While the scope defines what *is* included, it may also hint at what is *excluded* and could be addressed later.
4. **Look for any sections discussing monitoring or long-term performance:** This might indicate plans for future assessments and potential additional work.
5. **Pay attention to any language about contingencies or risk management:** These sections might mention potential future stabilization needs if certain risks materialize.

Without the document, I cannot definitively say if there are future plans mentioned. Good luck!
