The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" outlines a shared responsibility between the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and the City of Toronto for the maintenance and administration of Humber Bay Park East. Here's a breakdown based on what's commonly seen in such agreements, acknowledging that the *specific* details are only fully available within the document itself:

**Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA):**

*   **Land Ownership & Management:** The TRCA often owns the land within conservation areas like Humber Bay Park East. This ownership grants them significant influence over land use and management practices. In many similar arrangements, TRCA's responsibilities include:
    *   **Conservation Management:** This is a primary focus. TRCA is responsible for the ecological health of the park, including habitat restoration and protection, water quality monitoring, and invasive species control.
    *   **Environmental Stewardship:** Implementing best practices for environmental sustainability within the park.
    *   **Permitting & Approvals:** TRCA is often the regulatory body for any construction, development, or significant alterations within the park boundaries.
    *   **Capital Improvements & Rehabilitation:** TRCA often leads or co-leads projects to improve the park's infrastructure, like shoreline stabilization, trail development, or habitat enhancements. This role would include planning, design, and construction management.
    *   **Risk Management and Safety:** Ensuring the park is safe for visitors, including managing potential hazards related to natural features (e.g., shoreline erosion, unstable slopes).
    *   **Stakeholder Engagement:** Consulting with the public and other stakeholders on park management decisions.

**City of Toronto:**

*   **Operational Maintenance & Programming:** The City of Toronto, through its Parks, Forestry & Recreation division, typically focuses on the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the park for public use. This commonly includes:
    *   **Routine Maintenance:** Grass cutting, garbage collection, trail maintenance, snow removal (where applicable), and general upkeep of park amenities (benches, picnic tables, etc.).
    *   **Park Programming:** Organizing and delivering recreational programs and events for the public. This could include nature walks, educational programs, community festivals, and sports activities.
    *   **Enforcement:** Enforcing park bylaws and regulations to ensure public safety and protect park resources. This could involve bylaw officers patrolling the park and addressing issues like illegal camping, vandalism, or off-leash dogs.
    *   **Security:** Providing security services to ensure public safety and deter crime.
    *   **Public Access & Amenities:** Maintaining access points, parking areas, washrooms, and other amenities for park visitors.
    *   **Communication:** Providing information to the public about park hours, rules, and upcoming events.
    *   **Budget Allocation:** Allocating city funds for the maintenance and operation of the park.

**Collaboration and Shared Responsibilities:**

It's crucial to understand that these roles often overlap, and effective park management requires close collaboration between the TRCA and the City of Toronto. This often involves:

*   **Joint Planning:** Developing a shared vision for the park's future and coordinating management activities.
*   **Information Sharing:** Sharing data and information about park conditions, user patterns, and environmental impacts.
*   **Joint Funding:** Sharing the costs of park maintenance and improvements.
*   **Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs):** Formal agreements that outline the specific roles and responsibilities of each party. The "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I" likely references or includes elements of such an agreement.

**In the context of "Phase I" of the project, the Project Brief likely details:**

*   **Specific responsibilities for the initial phase of development or rehabilitation.** This could include who is responsible for the design, construction, and initial maintenance of new features or infrastructure.
*   **The roles of each organization in obtaining permits and approvals.**
*   **The communication plan for keeping the public informed about the project.**
*   **The budget allocation for Phase I and how costs will be shared.**

**Therefore, to get a definitive answer about the specific roles and responsibilities of TRCA and the City of Toronto in Humber Bay Park East as described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase I," you need to consult the document itself.** The above information is a general framework based on typical arrangements. The project brief would contain the specific details relevant to that particular park and project phase.
