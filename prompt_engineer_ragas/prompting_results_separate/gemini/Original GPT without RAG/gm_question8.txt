While I don't have access to specific documentation from the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project (as that would be a specific, internal document), I can outline common long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies typically employed for erosion control measures in similar projects. These strategies are based on best practices in coastal engineering and environmental management.

**General Principles:**

*   **Adaptive Management:**  The core principle is to monitor the performance of the erosion control measures and adjust the maintenance strategy as needed based on observed results.  This requires a feedback loop between monitoring, analysis, and action.

*   **Regular Inspections:** Scheduled inspections are crucial to identify potential problems early.

*   **Documentation:**  Detailed records of inspections, maintenance activities, and performance assessments are essential for tracking the effectiveness of the measures and informing future decisions.

*   **Proactive Maintenance:**  Addressing minor issues promptly can prevent them from escalating into major problems.

**Specific Strategies & Monitoring Parameters (Examples):**

Here's a breakdown by common erosion control measures and associated monitoring/maintenance:

*   **Riprap (Rock Armor):**

    *   **Monitoring:**
        *   **Visual Inspections:**  Regularly check for displacement of rocks, settlement, voids, or signs of undermining.  Pay close attention after storm events.
        *   **Profile Surveys:**  Periodically measure the profile of the riprap slope to detect any significant changes in elevation or shape.  Compare to baseline data.
        *   **Vegetation Encroachment:** Monitor for excessive vegetation growth within the riprap, which can sometimes destabilize the structure.
        *   **Settlement/Subsidence:** Look for signs of settlement or subsidence of the underlying soil, which can lead to riprap failure.
    *   **Maintenance:**
        *   **Rock Replacement:**  Replace any displaced or damaged rocks.
        *   **Repairs to Undermining:**  Fill voids and repair any areas where the riprap is being undermined by wave action or currents.
        *   **Vegetation Control:**  Remove excessive vegetation.
        *   **Re-grading:** Re-grade if significant settlement occurs.

*   **Seawalls/Bulkheads:**

    *   **Monitoring:**
        *   **Visual Inspections:**  Check for cracks, spalling, corrosion, or displacement of wall sections.  Look for signs of settlement, tilting, or bulging.
        *   **Joint Inspections:**  Examine joints for deterioration or water leakage.
        *   **Toe Scour:**  Inspect the base of the wall for scour caused by wave action.
        *   **Drainage:**  Verify proper functioning of drainage systems behind the wall.
    *   **Maintenance:**
        *   **Crack Repair:**  Fill cracks with appropriate sealant or patching material.
        *   **Corrosion Control:**  Apply protective coatings to steel reinforcement to prevent corrosion.
        *   **Joint Sealing:**  Re-seal joints to prevent water infiltration.
        *   **Toe Protection:**  Install or repair toe protection (e.g., riprap) to prevent scour.
        *   **Drainage Maintenance:**  Clean and maintain drainage systems.

*   **Vegetated Shorelines/Bioengineering:**

    *   **Monitoring:**
        *   **Vegetation Cover:**  Assess the density, health, and species composition of the vegetation.
        *   **Soil Stability:**  Monitor for erosion or instability of the soil.
        *   **Sediment Accretion/Erosion:**  Track sediment deposition or erosion rates.
        *   **Plant Survival Rates:** Track plant survival rates, especially after initial planting.
    *   **Maintenance:**
        *   **Replanting:**  Replant vegetation in areas where it has died or been damaged.
        *   **Weed Control:**  Control invasive species.
        *   **Fertilization:**  Apply fertilizer to promote vegetation growth.
        *   **Erosion Repair:**  Repair any areas of erosion or instability.
        *   **Sediment Management:**  Manage sediment deposition or erosion to maintain the desired shoreline profile.

*   **Beach Nourishment:**

    *   **Monitoring:**
        *   **Beach Profile Surveys:**  Regularly measure the beach profile to track changes in width, slope, and volume of sand.
        *   **Sediment Analysis:**  Periodically analyze the grain size and composition of the beach sand.
        *   **Erosion Hotspots:**  Identify areas of accelerated erosion.
    *   **Maintenance:**
        *   **Renourishment:**  Replenish the beach with sand as needed to maintain the desired width and slope.
        *   **Sand Fencing/Dune Stabilization:**  Install or maintain sand fencing or dune stabilization measures to trap sand and prevent erosion.

**Frequency of Monitoring:**

*   **Initial Period:**  More frequent monitoring (e.g., monthly) is typically required during the first year or two after installation to identify any initial problems.
*   **Long-Term:**  The frequency can then be reduced to quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, depending on the performance of the measures and the site conditions.
*   **Post-Storm Events:**  Inspections should be conducted immediately after significant storm events.

**Reporting and Action Levels:**

*   Establish clear reporting protocols and action levels.  For example, if a certain percentage of riprap is displaced, a specific repair action should be triggered.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Climate Change:**  Account for the potential impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise and increased storm frequency and intensity, when designing and maintaining erosion control measures.
*   **Environmental Regulations:**  Ensure that all monitoring and maintenance activities comply with applicable environmental regulations.
*   **Stakeholder Engagement:**  Engage with stakeholders, such as local residents and community groups, to gather feedback and address any concerns.
