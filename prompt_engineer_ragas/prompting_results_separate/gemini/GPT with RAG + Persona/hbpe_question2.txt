Based on the provided documents, here's how the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project (specifically Phase II as described in the "HBPE Project Brief - Phase II") impacts local wildlife, particularly aquatic species:

*   **Aquatic Habitat Alteration & Loss:** The project considers the effect of the proposed structure on aquatic habitat, evaluating the areas of fish habitat that would be altered or lost due to construction (Design Brief - Phase II_DRAFT.pdf, page 25).

*   **Habitat Features:** Discussions are underway between TRCA, DFO, City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 30). Habitat features were installed as part of Phase I, consisting of surcharged stone at the base of the revetment at several points along the deepest part of the structure. A similar approach is planned for Phase II (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 30).

*   **Baseline Inventory:** A baseline inventory includes aquatic species. Common species found include Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt (Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 14). The project also lists other aquatic species, including Round Goby, Shorthead Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, Spotfin Shiner, and Spottail Shiner (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 20). Another document lists Rainbow Smelt, Rainbow Trout, Rock Bass, Round Goby, Shorthead Redhorse, and Smallmouth Bass (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 18).

*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Staging and stockpiling areas will be isolated with standard silt socks to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 33).

*   **Minimizing Disturbance:** The protection structures were designed to minimize cutting and disturbing of native material, assuming the shoreline material had potential to be contaminated (Design Brief - Phase II_DRAFT.pdf, page 22).
