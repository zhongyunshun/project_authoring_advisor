The "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief" addresses potential impacts on biodiversity in the following ways:

*   **Bat Species:** Bat habitat is present within the project area, and appropriate compensation will be coordinated by TRCA’s ERM Project staff in accordance with the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) Bat Survey Protocol.
*   **Butternut:** A Category 2 butternut has been identified within the project area, generally located along the proposed access route. The document refers to TRCA’s 2018-12-05 Biological Inventory Memo for more information.
*   **Tree Removals:** The document mentions required tree removals and includes a section on hazardous plants screening. For additional information pertaining to the tree inventory and proposed removals/injuries, it refers to TRCA’s Arborist Report and Tree Preservation Plan for the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project.
*   **Species at Risk:** A terrestrial biological survey was undertaken to inventory existing flora and fauna.
*   **Restoration:** Post-construction restoration activities will focus on replanting suitable native species to compensate for those that were removed and enhance the overall biodiversity of the Project area.
