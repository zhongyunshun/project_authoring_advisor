The Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project is divided into three phases for design and implementation, due to the extent of the project area and the multi-year nature of construction (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 4). Final site restoration will occur following completion of all three phases of the project, with the exception of some preliminary restoration along the Eastern Headland (seeding and trail repairs) following completion of Phase I (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 35). Beach material will eventually be placed to the east of a structure as part of Phase III (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 27).
