The erosion occurring along German Mills Creek within German Mills Settlers Park poses a risk to trail infrastructure and is considered a potential safety hazard to park users, impacting public safety and potentially requiring safety features like fences. The project aims to preserve public enjoyment of the natural space while addressing the erosion issues. (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, pages 30, 371, 40)
