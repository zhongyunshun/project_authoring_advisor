Based on the provided documents, here are some strategies outlined in the "2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf" to promote sustainable development and conservation throughout the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project:

*   **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures:** Prior to construction, the work area will be isolated with standard sediment control fencing to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse. These barriers will be inspected and maintained throughout construction until the site is stabilized (Document 12, page 15).
*   **Minimizing Construction Footprint:** Efforts are made to minimize the construction footprint to reduce impacts on existing natural habitat (Document 8, page 26 in "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf").
*   **Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented (Document 8, page 26 in "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf").
*   **Addressing Drainage and Stormwater Runoff:** The selected alternative for the project provides an opportunity to address drainage and stormwater runoff concerns (Document 9, page 44 in "2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf").
