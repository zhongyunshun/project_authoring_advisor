The Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project incorporates several measures to protect local wildlife and minimize disruption, particularly for aquatic species. These include:

*   **Aquatic Habitat Considerations:** Discussions are underway between TRCA, DFO, City of Toronto, and Shoreplan regarding the development of aquatic habitat features for the design, with a proposed habitat component consisting of a surcharged revetment (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 30).
*   **Minimizing Disturbance:** Protection structures are designed to minimize cutting and disturbing native material, acknowledging the potential for contamination in the shoreline's native composition (Design Brief - Phase II\_DRAFT.pdf, page 22).
*   **Erosion and Sediment Control:** Staging and stockpiling areas are isolated with standard silt socks to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 32; HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 33).
*   **Tree Protection:** Tree protection barriers are erected where necessary, avoiding grade changes and material storage within the Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 33).
*   **Site Restoration:** Disturbed areas are restored to existing conditions or better, including vegetation (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 33).
*   **Monitoring:** TRCA's Aquatic Monitoring and Management (AMM) Group regularly collects fish population data using electrofishing at three monitoring stations near Humber Bay Park East, including Southern Beach and East Headland (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 19).
*   **Relocation of bird nesting boxes:** Bird nesting boxes within the staging area will be relocated (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 26).

The baseline inventory included species such as Alewives, White Suckers, and Rainbow Smelt (Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 14). The project also considers invasive species like the Round Goby and native species like the Shorthead Redhorse and Smallmouth Bass (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 20).
