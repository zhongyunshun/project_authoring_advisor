The documents outline several long-term monitoring and maintenance strategies for erosion control measures, particularly within the Humber Bay Park East Shoreline Maintenance Project.

**Post-Construction Monitoring:**

*   **Annual Inspections:** The sites are to be inspected annually to ensure the implemented works are stable and performing as designed (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 36; HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 37). Inspections also occur after major storm events during the first year.
*   **Maintenance:** Any required maintenance will be performed as needed based on the inspections (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 36; HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 37).
*   **Vegetation Monitoring:** Monitoring of proposed vegetation should be conducted for two years after planting to ensure survivability (2015-05-19 Cole AREA E - Peacham Cres.pdf, page 5).
*   **Photographic Records:** Pre- and post-construction erosion monitoring should include a record of photographs (2015-05-19 Cole AREA E - Peacham Cres.pdf, page 5).

**Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Measures:**

*   **Regular Monitoring During Construction:** Trained professionals will conduct regular monitoring during construction to ensure all best management practices are being used to avoid or minimize disturbance to the environment (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 45).
*   **Repair of Damaged Measures:** Any damaged or defective ESC measures will be repaired upon detection (German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 45). Damaged erosion and sediment control measures should be repaired and/or replaced within 48 hours of the inspection (Detailed Design - Phase I.pdf, page 4).
*   **Adaptive Strategies:** The erosion and sediment control strategies outlined on the plans are not static and may need to be upgraded/amended as site conditions change to minimize sediment laden runoff from leaving the work areas (Detailed Design - Phase I.pdf, page 4).
*   **Re-vegetation:** Effective erosion and sediment control measures will be maintained until the site is re-vegetated (HBPE Project Brief - Phase II.pdf, page 34; German Mills - Project File with Appendices.pdf, page 45).

**Overall Approach:**

*   **Prioritize Long-Term Resiliency:** The designs prioritize long-term resiliency while reducing the need for excavation and off-site disposal to limit disturbance and impacts of the construction activities (HBPE Project Brief - Phase I.pdf, page 26).
*   **Address Erosion Concerns:** Addressing the leading erosion concerns, including low crest elevation and wave overtopping (Humber Bay Park East Concept Brief.pdf, page 15).
*   **Minimize Disturbance:** Disturbed areas will be minimized to the extent possible, and temporarily or permanently stabilized or restored as the work progresses (Detailed Design - Phase I.pdf, page 4).
