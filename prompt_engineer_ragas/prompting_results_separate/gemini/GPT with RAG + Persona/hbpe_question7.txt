Based on the provided documents from the TRCA regarding the Humber Bay Park East Major Maintenance Project, here's how the erosion control structures were chosen, considering effectiveness and environmental impact:

*   **Addressing Erosion Concerns:** The primary goal was to address erosion concerns within the park, specifically issues like low crest elevation and wave overtopping. Proposed concepts involved placing new material over existing structures where toe and slope stability permitted, minimizing excavation. (Document 5)

*   **Structural Stability and Condition:** The condition of existing erosion control structures (armourstone headlands, gravel/rubble beach) was assessed to determine deficiencies like displacement of armourstone, scouring, undercutting, and slumping. (Documents 3, 18)

*   **Specific Structure Examples and Considerations:**

    *   **Armourstone Headlands (WF11.10, WF11.12):** These structures showed signs of displacement, scouring, and backshore erosion, requiring maintenance. (Documents 2, 3)
    *   **Cobble/Rubble Beach (WF11.11):** This area exhibited slumping, undercutting, scouring, and material displacement, impacting informal trails. (Documents 18, 22) Smaller cobble sizes were considered for a more user-friendly beach, but with the understanding that this would require more material, potentially leading to higher costs, a larger in-water footprint, and greater maintenance needs. (Document 11)
*   **Pond Drainage:** The design included creating a berm with armourstone to create a formal outlet area for the ponds. (Document 8, 12)

*   **Minimizing Environmental Impact:** The design aimed to minimize cutting and disturbing native material, recognizing the potential for contamination. (Document 19) Erosion and sediment control measures, such as silt socks, were implemented to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse during construction. (Documents 9, 10)
