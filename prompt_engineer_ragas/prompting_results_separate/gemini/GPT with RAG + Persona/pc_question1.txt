Based on the provided documents related to the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, here's how the Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC) is defined and determined:

**Definition:**

*   The LTSSC models the natural regression of a slope crest resulting from erosion forces and is based on the composition and conditions of substrate materials (Document 2).
*   The area between the existing top of bank and the LTSSC will be at risk of being undermined (Document 15).

**Criteria and Determination:**

*   **Factor of Safety (FoS):** The LTSSC is determined using a factor of safety. In the Peacham Crescent project, an FoS of 1.5 was initially used (Documents 2, 4, 9, 10). However, other documents mention an LTSSC with a factor of safety of 1.3 (Documents 3, 5, 14, 18).
*   **Subsurface Investigation:** Cole Engineering Group Ltd. conducted a subsurface investigation to delineate the LTSSC behind Peacham Crescent (Document 2). Soil Engineers Ltd. also conducted borehole drilling to evaluate the LTSSC (Document 8).
*   **Geotechnical Investigation:** A geotechnical investigation was completed to determine the position of the LTSSC along the valley slope behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent (Document 9).
*   **Slope Stability & Erosion Risk Assessment (SS&ERA):** The SS&ERA, initiated by TRCA, revealed the anticipated Long Term Stable Slope Crest (Document 11, 17).
*   **Field Investigations:** Field investigations were used to propose preliminary alternatives based on feasibility and the ability to mitigate risk to infrastructure, private property, and human life (Document 8).
*   **Consideration of Structures:** The location of the projected LTSSC is considered in relation to permanent and essential structures at the top of the slope (Document 1). It was found that the LTSSC for a Factor of Safety of 1.5 would intersect the residential dwelling at 21 Peacham Crescent (Document 6).

In summary, the LTSSC is a modeled line representing the long-term stable position of the slope crest, considering erosion forces and material properties. It is determined through geotechnical investigations, subsurface analysis, and the application of a factor of safety, with consideration given to the proximity of structures and potential risks.
