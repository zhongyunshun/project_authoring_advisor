Based on the "2019-04-02 Conceptual Alt. Report Peacham_Final.pdf", the key factors influencing the selection of the preferred conceptual slope stabilization alternatives for the valley slope located behind 21, 23 and 25 Peacham Crescent included a Factor of Safety (FOS) of 1.3 as requested by TRCA, and the stabilization of the upper 3 to 6 m portion of the slope where the slope failure occurred (Document 9). The alternatives were also developed utilizing topographic data provided by TRCA and subsurface information from a report prepared by Cole and Soil Engineers (Document 14).
