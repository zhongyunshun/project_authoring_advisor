Based on the provided documents related to the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, here's an overview of the anticipated environmental and social impacts, and how the project plans to address them:

**Environmental Impacts:**

*   **Wildlife Habitat:** The project considers potential effects on wildlife habitat. The document uses a rating system to assess these effects (e.g., -H, -M, -L, NIL, +L, +M, +H, NA). (Document 1, 7, 12)
*   **Habitat Linkages or Corridors:** Similar to wildlife habitat, potential impacts on habitat linkages or corridors are assessed. (Document 1)
*   **Significant Vegetation Communities:** The project considers potential impacts on significant vegetation communities. (Document 1)
*   **Wetlands:** There were two wetland vegetation communities observed along the southern limits of the Project area (Document 9)
*   **Unique Landforms:** The project states that there are no known unique landforms within or adjacent to the Project limits, so no impacts are expected. (Document 10, 12)
*   **Existing Natural Habitat:** The project aims to minimize impacts on existing natural habitat by using the smallest construction footprint possible and scheduling activities outside of key migration and breeding windows. A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented. (Document 18)
*   **Rate of Erosion in Ecosystem:** The potential for erosion and slope instability within a local ecosystem is greatly influenced by the type of landuse of the surrounding areas. (Document 19)

**Social Impacts:**

*   **Surrounding Neighbourhood or Community:** The project considers potential impacts on the surrounding neighborhood or community. (Document 7)
*   **Surrounding Land Uses or Growth Pressure:** Impacts on surrounding land uses or growth pressure are assessed. (Document 7)
*   **Existing Infrastructure, Support:** The project considers potential impacts on existing infrastructure and support systems. (Document 7)
*   **Property Accessibility:** Two possible access route options have been proposed to gain access to the slope behind 21, 23, and 25 Peacham Crescent. (Document 6)
*   **Public Safety:** The project considers potential risks to public safety, especially along trails and on the slope, and the need for safety features like fences. (Document 11)
*   **Recreational or Tourist Uses:** The adjacent parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent is actively used for recreational purposes. (Document 13)
*   **Long-Term Stable Slope Crest (LTSSC):** The location of the projected long-term stable slope crest (LTSSC) in relation to permanent and essential structures at the top of slope is considered. (Document 2)
*   **Public Footpath:** The presence of a public footpath at the base of the slope is a consideration. (Document 2)
*   **Impacted Infrastructure:** The presence of potentially impacted infrastructure located within the tributary and surrounding area is considered. (Document 2)

**How Impacts are Addressed:**

*   **Class EA Process:** The project is being completed in accordance with the Class Environmental Assessment for Remedial Flood and Erosion Control Projects, amended 2013 (Class EA). (Document 5)
*   **Screening Criteria:** The project uses screening criteria to rate the potential effects on various environmental and social factors. (Document 1, 7, 12)
*   **Public Consultation:** Public consultation occurred with the publication of the Notice of Intent on November 22, 2018. Notices were sent to community groups, homeowners, and Indigenous communities. (Document 4)
*   **Minimizing Construction Footprint:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible. (Document 18)
*   **Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented to address impacts on existing natural habitat. (Document 18)
*   **Project Objectives:** The selected alternative meets all three (3) of the Project objectives, including risk mitigation. (Document 8)
*   **Ecology Survey:** A terrestrial biological survey of the natural area within and surrounding the Project area was undertaken by TRCAâ€™s Environmental Monitoring and Data Management (EMDM) to inventory existing flora, fauna. (Document 21)

**Overall Goal:**

The primary goal of the Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project is to protect human life and property from the hazards of valley slope erosion by providing long-term, low-maintenance protection. (Document 3, 5) The project aims to reduce risk to life and property, as per the mandate of Conservation Authorities under the Conservation Authorities Act (R.S.O 1990). (Document 5)
