TRCA engages with Indigenous communities in various ways, depending on the project's scope and the communities' interests. This engagement aims to provide Indigenous communities with opportunities to receive information and provide input on project proposals, allowing TRCA to identify and address potential impacts on Indigenous rights and interests (Document 3). TRCA recognizes the importance of consulting with Aboriginal communities on planning matters that may affect their rights and interests, acknowledging the presence of overlapping traditional territories and Treaty areas within its jurisdiction (Document 11).

For example, the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project involved sending notices to Indigenous communities (Document 19). A record of Indigenous community consultation for the Peacham Crescent project can be found in Appendix D (Document 13). Similarly, for the German Mills Park Sanitary Infrastructure Protection Project, TRCA engaged with Indigenous communities and provided a summary of correspondence (Document 14).

TRCA also consults with various First Nations and Indigenous organizations, including Beausoleil First Nation, Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, Chippewas of Rama-Mnjikaning First Nation, Conseil de la Nation Huronne-Wendat, and others (Document 7).
