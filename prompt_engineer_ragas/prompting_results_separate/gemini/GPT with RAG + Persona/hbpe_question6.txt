The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project addresses potential social impacts and ensures the safety of the local community through several measures:

*   **Risk Mitigation:** The primary objective of the project is to protect human life and property from the hazards of erosion and slope instability, particularly following a slope failure behind properties on Peacham Crescent after a severe weather event (Documents 5, 21).

*   **Public Safety:** The project considers the potential risks to public safety along the trail and slope, and evaluates the requirement for safety features such as safety fences (Document 3).

*   **Pedestrian Traffic:** The project acknowledges the presence of an active paved pedestrian pathway within the parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent and plans for temporary restrictions to pedestrian traffic during construction (Document 9).

*   **Public Consultation:** As part of the Class EA process, the project involves public notification and consultation, including sending notices to community groups, homeowners in the vicinity, and Indigenous communities (Document 18).

*   **Erosion and Sediment Control Measures:** Prior to construction, the work area will be isolated with sediment control fencing to prevent deleterious substances from entering the watercourse. These barriers will be inspected and maintained throughout construction until the site is stabilized (Document 13).
