Based on the provided documents regarding the Peacham Crescent Erosion Control and Slope Stabilization Project, here's what can be inferred about measures to mitigate impacts on local wildlife:

*   **Limited Significant Wildlife Impacts:** The documents state that there are no significant wildlife populations identified within the Project limits; therefore, there are no anticipated impacts resulting from the proposed works (Document 1).

*   **Minimizing Construction Footprint:** Construction activities are planned to have the smallest construction footprint as possible (Document 3).

*   **Timing of Construction:** Construction will occur outside of key migration and breeding windows when habitat use is not as crucial (Document 3). This is specifically mentioned in relation to bird breeding activities (Document 18).

*   **Restoration Plan:** A comprehensive restoration plan will be implemented (Document 3).

*   **Minimizing Vegetation Removal:** Tree removal will be minimal and highly selective to avoid overall impact to vegetation communities (Document 13).

*   **Sediment and Erosion Control:** Prior to construction, the work area will be isolated with standard sediment control fencing to prevent the entry of deleterious substances into the watercourse (Document 8).

*   **Consideration for Bird Habitat:** The project aims to minimize impacts to bird habitat through selective removal of canopy trees, and construction will occur outside the bird breeding window (Document 18).
