Based on the provided documents, here's information regarding engagements and consultations with local Indigenous communities during project planning and implementation phases:

*   **General Approach:** TRCA's approach to Indigenous engagement involves providing Indigenous communities with opportunities to receive information and provide input on project proposals. This allows TRCA to consider the concerns and issues of those communities (Document 1, 2). TRCA aims to develop positive relationships with Aboriginal communities whose interests may be impacted by TRCA projects, through meaningful and mutually respectful engagement (Document 11). The communication process respects the culture and practices of the Indigenous communities being engaged, and incorporates open dialogue and regular opportunities for feedback (Document 4).

*   **Consultation Process:** Prior to notifications, the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP) and the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation (MIRR) were contacted for advice and information on which Indigenous communities should be contacted during the engagement process (Document 2, 10). Additional Indigenous community contact lists were also considered (Document 2, 10).

*   **Specific Communities Consulted:** Several Indigenous communities have been consulted, including:

    *   Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation (MNCFN) (Document 8, 15).
    *   Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation (MSIFN) (Document 8, 19).
    *   Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation (Document 16).
    *   Williams Treaties First Nations (Document 3).
    *   Huron-Wendat Nation (Document 3).
    *   Hiawatha First Nation (Document 17, 19).

*   **Engagement Activities:**

    *   Notification packages are couriered and emailed (Document 9).
    *   Archaeological Assessments: Nations were informed about completed Stage 1-2 Archaeological Assessments, and copies were provided to those who expressed interest. All nations were assured they would be notified if additional archaeology was required (Document 8).
    *   Environmental Studies: Information about planned archaeological assessments and environmental studies was shared, and some nations indicated interest in participation from Field Liaison Representatives (FLRs) (Document 15). Some nations were provided with a memo summarizing environmental studies and digital access to completed studies (Document 19).

*   **Documentation:** A full record of Indigenous community consultation, including copies of all correspondence, can be found in the Record of Indigenous Engagement for specific projects (Document 6).

*   **No Adverse Effects Identified:** In at least one project, no adverse effects on traditional land uses were identified during engagement with Indigenous communities (Document 3).
