The Peacham Crescent Slope Stabilization Project involves tree removals to facilitate construction access, with 180 trees slated for removal and another 38 expected to be injured (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 14). To minimize impacts on existing natural habitat, construction activities are planned to have the smallest footprint possible and occur outside key migration and breeding windows (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26). Post-construction restoration activities will focus on replanting suitable native species to compensate for those removed and enhance the overall biodiversity of the Project area (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27).

Regarding species at risk, a Category 2 butternut tree was identified within the project area (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 11), and a genetically pure butternut was located within the construction access route (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 27). TRCA has obtained the appropriate permits and approvals to complete any works within the project site (2021-09-29 Peacham Cres Project Brief_Final.pdf, page 11). Although there are no significant wildlife populations identified within the Project limits, therefore, there are no anticipated impacts resulting from the proposed works (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 28). The project aims to minimize tree removals and impacts to the surrounding natural environment (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 37). Tree removal will be minimal and highly selective; therefore, there should be no overall impact to the welfare of vegetation communities within the parkland corridor behind Peacham Crescent resulting from the proposed works (2019-09-26 Peacham Class EA PP.pdf, page 26).
